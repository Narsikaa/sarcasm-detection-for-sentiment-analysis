My take away on #DeflateGate after listening to Brady: Maybe the balls weren't light. Maybe the scale was broke.  #cheaters
I bet he would rather eat his own balls then attend this press conference. Poor Tom Brady.
I'm glad Tom Brady came dressed to impress for his press conference. Nice beanie. #DeflateGate #sweats
I'm sure Tom Brady didn't realize the balls were under inflated.  #hottakes
" #flexball" displayed behind tom Brady's press conference. Ironic? I think not!  what's wrong with the media these days...
The only thing we can surmise is the ball boy acted as the lone gunman.  #DeflateGate
Belichick and Brady both say they know nothing... I'm shocked!
You guys are all welcome...he committed because I tweeted him over and over telling to be a Hog
Wow, I am so glad that nothing else is going on in the entire world cause it would get no overage! #DeflateGate

Bigger story: Patriots deflate footballs, or A-rod asking Bonds to be his coach.
Halford's 'wefit' doesn't sound like the games console game, does it?
If the Patriots did deflate balls, being a lifelong fan, I will never be able to cheer for them again, those bastards!

Only 11 of 12 Patriots balls under-inflated? That seems like a perfectly acceptable number to prove the issue was coincidental.

So the #Patriots are a bunch of cheaters! #BigShocker
Hopefully espn does one of those Sports Science segments to explain deflate gate & psi indoors vs outdoors. #Imnotgoodatscience
Can't sleep which is awesome since I have an 8am class

I'm sure deflated footballs are what made the Patriots 38 points better than the Colts....
Everyone just loves being let down by someone they actually believed was different

New England Patriots....cheating? I'm shocked.  #inflategate
Could this day get any better? .
Now then, let's just give the Super Bowl to the Seahawks by forfeit!
Love sitting around doing nothing while you sleep on my couch.. #alright  #gtfo
Because fully inflated footballs would make up for a 38 point difference #inflategate
This begs the question. Why are the balls not checked pre-game????? Such a flaw in a such a historically "flawless" system.
I guess sports are more important than education.
Way to be gracious, Maria Sharapova. #Lies

Wow I can't even tell if this republican response is scripted or not!

But he's Bill Belichick and a legend, he's good at cheating, so you should deal with it & stop being jealous.

Josie deserves a slap just for saying "snuck-en in". She's right though -- no1 will EVER guess she's a drop-out!  #Help4Teen #DrPhil
Bertuzzi's a UFA at the moment. Maybe we can sign him for the Blackhawks game so he can do the 'hit' on Carcillo?  #NHLJets
The New England Patriots guilty of cheating? Nah. Can't be. Not them.  #OnceACheaterAlwaysACheater
Being Canadian means always being on #Winterwatch living in igloos, surviving off maple syrup and dodging flying hockey pucks

Having a real great start to the week.
Remember when the Flyers used to be good? Hope McDavid can turn this ship around. Just give him the C now
So glad I taught my kids the name game  #yikes #TimeToGoPlayOutside
I love the people that say "we", like they played in the game themselves.
I'm still trying to find a handful of items since moving almost a year ago! One of those lovely added benefits of a move...
This #DeflateGate is awesome. Bill Belichick and Tom Brady have built their unrivaled success in the NFL on a foundation of lies.
Loveeeeee the pedophile wolf scene in "into the woods"
Can't wait to spend my day reading the many chapters of chem, stats, history & philosophy due by Wed
The circle line is so great #london  #tfl

Still in the JCMC, might stay one more night. Having so much fun.

I hate couples. Do ye not have sex to do or somethin'? Instead of sitting in front of me on the bus being all lovey-dovey!
My son's mother is such a good person  #dohkay
How can we appeal to the racist Tory right. I know, write to a bunch of mosques to tell them radical Islam is their fault. Genius
Yeah, so the Nats signed Scherzer. THE METS got CUDDYER and John Mayberry, Jr. Take THAT, NL EAST.
Thank you, Monday, for not disappointing me with your frustrations. I was worried. #not
the world needs more loser welfare women with kids.. they are the best!
My job title loosely translates to Dirt Cheap Labor. Yes, I am feeling valued and appreciated today.  #OverworkedAndUnderpaid
Wait the Pats cheated? That's SO surprising!
Writing a novel is never more fun than when you're babysitting your niece and the kids are out of school for the day. #amwriting
The #Patriots are under investigation for cheating? Huh...they have such a strong track record of integrity.
Fowler to the Cubs, but please, let's just keep laughing at the Cubs like they're no real threat.
I don't know why I don't come to the asian supermarkets more often, all the bad bitches are here.
In school on a national holiday. College is fun.
Patriots are being investigated for cheating (again)? Wow I'm stunned!!!
They are definitely going to rebuild the hat. It's coming down in perfect little pieces.
#FYI: If a woman tells you that you’re right, that’s called .
Oh wow, red cups? RED CUPS? what a banging club night that's gonna be
Love when ppl wax poetic about ppl who they cheated on or were cheated on by but still screw.
Don't listen to the young kid! Never knows what he's talking about!
Guess what I have to do today? I get to go to the eye doctor!!! #SGU
By no means is it the reason we lost but I won't be surprised if the Pats really did deflate the footballs #classorganization
The Patriots have been accused of cheating!? what? no way, they have never been accused of cheating before.  #cheaters
The more you drink meal replacement the less awful it tastes....
Patriots cheated to win?? I am shocked!!!!!
I think the Boogeyman is so cute.
The Patriots cheated? I'm Shocked. #NFL #Patriots
I'm not sick. I don't have the worst sore throat ever. I'm NOT catching a cold.
What!?! Bill Belichick and the Patriots being investigated for cheating, again! I am shocked! #not  #nfl #INDvsNE
My next pet project: invent+popularize terminology to undermine rivals and dehumanize by continual usage. Oh, and to make a few $.
Crew doesn't need work or a work schedule. You just make the "season" as small and as cheap as possible and call us when you can.
What? The Cardinals didn't sign Scherzer? I'm so surprised  #cardinals
Animal products are the way to go, folks!!
WHAT?!!!! The Patriots may have cheated?!!! How shocking and unprecedented?!!!! #irony  #ColtsNation #nfl #NewEnglandPatriots

Oh no its even worse than spygate its DEFLATEGATE #pats #smh
Wow I love having the voice of an 80 year old man.  #sick
How dare President Obama let the football be deflated? #NFLPlayoffs #Obama
Guys, the Power Rangers Movie starts filming this year! Didn't see that coming at all!
If #Patriots deflated balls, maybe #Bills get their 2015, 1st Rd pick back. That will really punish them good. As if that matters
Anyone on here got that picture of Fabregas and his mum and dad?
Top marks for maccies drive through for always giving fresh chips

Joy is when your 1 year old son wakes up at 4:30am and won't go back to sleep.  #playtime #offschedule
If only #Colts had a "deflated ball" running back I bet the outcome would have been a lot different  #NFLPlayoffs #PatriotsNation
I'm so glad to know my internal clock still works on days I have off.
12 hour shift today, woo I'm so excited!
I've been so busy with real life that i forgot my web one. Since when our real life is more important then the web life? Madness.
Gotten more pictures of Zayn these couple of days, than I have in my lifetime of loving Zayn
Huge round of applause to PennDot this morning on the roads
Already off to a greaattt start this morning.
Patriots might've been cheating again. Well this is a surprise.
Oh lovely, another sociopathic, self-entitled, self-centered man-child produced by bad parenting. How fresh and new....
Haha can't believe they replied to that
Mmmm I got so much sleep I don't know what to do with myself
Fear not, citizens. On this National Holiday, the cement sales group will be hard at their labors. You're welcome.  #wishwewereoff

Yeah, we got some real lovely folks back home.
30% drop in w/sale gas price, 5% cut to customers, end of next month. Perfectly fair.
Its good to see the ANC took a mature, level headed response to Zelda's rant and didn't stoop to her level and use racial terms!
The crowd at the Kokkinakis 5-setter seems so bored, I bet they wish it was Fast4 #AO15  #fast4tennisisawful
I'm surprised more football fans don't become managers as lots of them seem to know better than the manager of their team!!!
absolutely great, not that I'm in a rush or anything or have work to submit for a deadline at 12pm
TIL ... Pseudomonads are "spore forming" ... & are called "Bacillus" ...
What I love about my phone is that it doesn't really work as a phone anymore.
Slow clap. Well done #BOM for getting a storm warning to #Townsville 15 after it passed. #goodjobguys
I see a lot of Russell Wilson in J Manziel! . Anyone comparing them probably should give it a rest.
Having a productive Monday. Just typed 125 words on a major article I have to submit in a few hours.  #journoprobs
My school shoes are so tidy.
I noticed in American Sniper only white people were shot and killed. Let's have an "Emergency" meeting with Hollywood!
Love that my tweet with a typo is getting so many retweets. c'est la vie.

If you need to  you're doing it wrong
Man, am I on a roll or what?
Hey guys! Apparently Molloys just became a professional pool bar.
Well I am sure that two & half hours sleep will really set me up for the day.  #insomnia
Its been a great night.  :)
Really sucks having to watch sport (NFL, Tennis, Golf, Asian Cup) all day #research
so the pats may have cheated again? not them!....not the patriots..they are the best in the league...no way THAT woudl happen....
I love hearing bass from my wannabe rapper neighbor who sits in his car sometimes just to hear his songs.....  #alldaylong #bequiet
You staring at your phone= Jerk. Me staring at my phone= Cool guy with lots of shit happening in his life.
Good morning all, and especially to #Eskom who has once again left me without power. 3 surges in 10secs. You guys rock

Picking berries in a suit? Totally normal. #ResHeads  #Resurrection
Well. That cinches it, the Braves are going to win the division. With the pitching in the division and our hitting, guaranteed.

Hey guys "nothing" is working well for Rafa apparently! Just watch the match vs youzhny

My fiancee talking to my long lost daughter who is moving in with us. Oh yeah THIS is gonna go well
Thinking we should just billboard the #SuperBowl. #JournalismTalk
I'd really like it if someone could tweet out another pic of Seahawks fans leaving early.
I speak 2 languages  and #RealShit!!!
I love my dogs laugh at horns honking on TV.
I read somewhere that the #Rams were looking for a new OC. Apparently, so was a half dozen other teams who already filled theirs.
Conor McGregor sure is a "real deal" 5th ranked fighter fighting a 10th ranked fighter. #HypeTrain  #UFC
I don't have feelings or anything
its awesome how my days off work and school are spent by myself
Over 10 billion Americans starve every 10 seconds because of capitalism.
Love the stream of email that comes in after being in airplane mode.
This Super Bowl is about to be awesome... #not
Being ignored feels great by you
The pro of having your father working with you is if he forgets something, he can easily ask you to pick it up for him.
Lol i swear i have the best luck at everything i do
I'm sure that $25,000 fine and one day in rehab taught Jon Jones one hell of a lesson.
Scholarships are so fun to look for!
Good think I work a double the next two days tho
Oh look a minimalist artsy indie game that is all pixel art. I have never seen that before
Wait so patriots are going to the super bowl? I couldn't tell from Twitter
My kid did this AMAZING thing that no other kid has ever done let me tell you all about it and lmao  #Facebook
Wow thank God for that tuck rule #thanksraylewis #TomBradyFacts
#LT glad to see my procrastination skills didn't lapse over winter break.  #whycantijustbedonealready
OF COURSE the Patriots are going to the super bowl. What a surprise.
oh and of course, emergency book another hotel somewhere else for 2x the price.. but it's ok we got the 15$ cancellation fee back.
#stillsalty I was pissed before. now I'm even more pissed.
When in doubt, just add some sausage fattener
It must really suck to be a Patriots fan.
is not just an attitude, it's a way of life!
NFL fans in America do not get to judge soccer fans in Europe. Hello pot, I would like to introduce you to kettle. .
I'm sure that people who struggle w/ obesity have never heard the facile pseudo-suggestion "just stop eating" before. #fatandback
One episode left. Then hiatus. Joy!  #lostgirl
Ecstatic to be in New Jersey
What's your plan now, oh smart smooth one?  #Revenge
I'm not good at gambling. Did patriots cover at 45-7?
The bigger the ass .. .. the bigger the purse
Does anybody else love being ignored or is that just me
Way to put up a fight Indy. Woo!
At least My elf #leveledup from protecting herself from rape #dragonage and gaming culture isn't #sexist  #rapeculture
2:00 warning - time for the greatest comeback in NFL history  - get Reggie his catch
These hockey night in Canada commentators are great!  #bringbackbeyek
I'll say it now... Should have been the Browns.
That was a huge third down stop for the Pats #clutch
The next two weeks of Seahawks and Patriots talk is gonna be awesome
"my nigga senses are tinglin." "going incognegro." Just two small excerpts of the classic comedy you can see on "A haunted house 2"
My parents just said I don't have any true friends, just people who use me. They always make me feel great about myself.
Getting ready for another example of why the shootout is so loved and awesome! #amiright #NHLJets
Not even a breakout performance by Trent Richardson could have made this game close...
Well I guess Luck is a bust. No Super Bowls and 0-4 against Brady!
Up 30 in the fourth quarter,all of your starters are still in the game, classy Belichick! #NFL  #NoMore #noengland
Thank you Indianapolis Colts for such a thrilling AFC final! It made #GBvSEA look like a Pop Warner game.  #whyshowup
So happy that the Seahawks won. Macklemore must be so proud of his city. He earned this. Congrats.
So who's all ready and excited for Richard Sherman and Marshawn Lynch's #SuperBowlXLIX week interviews?
This economics project is really fun! #saidnooneever
I wasn't aware the Chiefs beat both of the Super Bowl teams this year. Seahawks and Patriots. Thanks for pointing that out.
Oh dang. It's 45-7. Bill Bellicheck needs to be suspended for running up the score
A5: Kill them with kindness! #txeduchat
love these re-tread coaches in the NFL  #whype #RooneyRule
I love it when people tell me what I need to do...especially when it involves my money.
So... Colts are playing pretty well tonight
So glad Tampa Bay got rid of Blount and Revis... We didn't need them. Not like they would help the team go to the next level  #nfl
I wonder who the #Seahawks are going to face in the superbowl?
When does the Patriots - Colts game start? #NFCChampionship
So Andrew Luck and the Indianapolis Andrew Lucks are getting blown out.. That's surprising...
I bet the #Steelers are real happy about cutting Blount now
I just couldn't be happier for one of the good guys in the NFL, LeGarrette Blount...
Can't wait to work a double tomorrow #yay
Colts aren't going down kicking and screaming. Fire pagano? Get rid of luck? Not the answer?
This game is honestly just too exciting  #fuckthepats
The #Patriots are trying to be deceptive? That doesn't sound like them.  #INDvsNE
Ok, well Demetria even though you're over-the-hill from a pop star ( ), even Phaedra has to admit she can sing! LOL #RHOA
I can't wait for the day when we have to censor everything because people have become so sensitive.  #DealWithIt
Does anyone else think that the Patriots are like a flea on a dog? #NEvsIND #justsayin
Now on my to-do list... See Hot-Tub Time Machine, so Hot-Tub Time Machine 2 makes sense when I see it in IMAX.
Test and 2 hw's due tomorrow!
Great tackling from the #Colts defense. . Inability to close up is hurting them on this #Patriots drive
So sorry if I haven't accepted your Facebook friend request. It's taking me so long to get through all of them.
Off topic - My MIL is watching #RHOA for the first time (great episode !) and asked if Kenya got her butt implanted. Not kidding LOL
Oh I'm Late To Class ? Please , Stare At Me Like I Just Killed Five People
here's to another year pretending that I like people
Wonderful how humble Nfl players are in post match interviews. Only talk about how they worked as a team to win. Lol
Seeing Talib, Blount, Bennett, Wright and Revis these last two weeks makes me really miss Dominik. . #smh #Bucs
Just a slight difference between that #Pagano interview and how a #Belichick interview would have gone down  #AFCChampionship
So grasping a jersey into a closed fist is no longer considered holding? Or can only certain ppl get out of the penalty?  #badcall
I can see they're definitely using the best refs for this game
I guess grabbing the receivers hips isn't pass interference. Learn something new everyday
You know what would totally catch them off guard? Brady QB draw?
Was there a football game or something today?
Glad to see the Jamaica-US U20 game being played on a high quality surface.
What's limit up in #corn?!  x2
Great to see such a great guy like LaGarret Blount having so much success.  #badguy
Gotta love gossip. Idk why people feel the need to talk about other people's business like they went through the experience them.
Glad to see John Kerry h a s priorities  .Sad to see he didn't bring James Taylor
Turned it back from the fights and oh what a surprise the Pats R winning  #NoUpsetNFL
Isn't it odd that media criticizes NJ Gov for being at Cowboys game but SS John Kerry is at NE game. World probs take back seat.
chicken & gravy w / rice or potatoes , idfk , i hate this part #PerksOfBeingIndecisive
It's refreshing to know that even in a sweatshirt, jeans, and sneakers, I'll still get honked at and cat called.
I love being ignored, it's my absolute fav.
Andrew Luck appears to throw an uncatchable ball.  #stonehands
It's so helpful when people tell you "don't get mad" or "get over it!" Wow that's so simple! Why didn't I think of that?
Knackered but totally wired, tonight could be fun
I didn't catch the game. Who's going to the Super Bowl?
Oh, are the Seahawks in the super bowl? I didn't know....  #seahawks #idontwatchfootball
I love having nothing to do ..
Well. Glad we came to play today.
I luv not even having conversations :-)
Altho do love how all these seahawks fans have come from nowhere..where were u when got routed wk in wk out while in AFC West ;)
That last tweet was . Learned in middle school.
Aaaaand just a little wide there
That football game just confirms that the CFL is way more entertaining. #pointforfailing
Wow. What a new concept for a TV show! The Odd Couple. I'm kinda stunned nobody ever thought of a comedy program like this before!
Blount is seriously lacking in "culture".  #INDvsNE
Super glad the refs aren't being favorable to the Patriots so far.  #NEvsIND
So I assume Seahawks won. Thanks for letting me know...my followers.
Back to back missed calls go Pats way??? Shocked.  #NEvsIND
Lush weather we had today... #british #weather
That got things off to a good start, well done Colts.
Already can't wait for Lynch and Sherman at media day.  #nothanks
Does anyone know if there is a football game on tonight?
Colts and Pats...thank you AFC for giving us a matchup we don't get too often.
The real winner? #Skittles for buying time for a Super Bowl ad.  #Kinda
If #Patriots win, we'll have the two smuggest coaches going against each other. That'd be so swell.  #INDvsNE
Thankfully York mutually agreed Harbaugh out the door or the 49ers would never have a chance of beating Seattle.
I'm gonna fucking hear this all week. Nice
If Hezbollah retaliates to Israel’s raid, this will be the first war to have a twitter Hashtag before it begun.
So pumped my mom is having a jewelry party during the football games
What a dream matchup of such likeable coaches Belicheck vs Carroll in the Super Bowl. Please Indy don't stand in the way ;)
Good news the Pats lost already.
I guess Aaron Rodgers now has to console himself in the arms of Olivia Munn. Poor guy. #SeahawksvsPackers
Well team Obamacare is in the Superbowl
- the use of irony to mock or portray contempt #EnglishOnlyPlease
Solid start to the new semester
The real shame here is that there's no late controversial overturned penalty/ruling to talk about for a third straight week.
I knew God had money on the Seahawks. #RussellWilson
I'm glad God allowed Seattle to win. See Packers? God hates you!!!
On the bright side, Africa is going to receive a nice package with "Green Bay NFC Champions 2015"
I can't for Richard Sherman to show his class by calling Jordy Nelson mediocre. #GBvSEA
#Review that catch! Did the ball move??? Did he complete the process???
It's not how you start. It's how you finish. Russel Wilson is the best qb to ever play the game.  #whatmediawillsaythisweek
It's not a catch  #GBvsSEA #NFCChampionship
Cant wait to hear about how great Russell Wilson is and how the 12th man is actually a thing
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT SH*T #GBvsSEA Sorry Packer Bros
Oh lovely...cuz I so wanted to see Seattle win
Gee, I did not expect that.
I'm not sure he had possession there.  #Maybe
Buffalo Wild Wings on a Sunday. Yay. I love people so much...  #football #holyJesusitsloud
Time for the best overtime rules in Football.
I was really hoping this game would end up being a little closer.  #NFCChampionship
The early field goals gave Mason Crosby the confidence to make that one #GBvSEA
THIS GAME HAS MORE DRAMA THAN ALL THE TWILIGHT MOVIES PUT TOGETHER  #12thMan
Wilson get Seahawks into fg range in 19 sec. No question he should be mvp #NFL
I knew this GB-SEA game would be boring.
Thakn you facebook for notifying me that my roommate is nearby. Its some valuable info.
It's crazy how creative kids shows are
Wow this is crazy! Richard Sherman playing with one arm and Aaron Rodgers playing with one leg!! #Madness
Way to go Green Bay.  #NFLPlayoffs #GBvsSEA
Isn't it nice how the OUAT cast is "terrified" to openly support/prefer a ship b/c of the "fans" that bully them if they do?
When did Braylon Edwards join the Packers? And who put him out there for the onside kick?
Garrett would have gone on 4th and goal... #justsaying
Nothing like Peyton Manning singing during the 2 minute warning.
It's too bad this game has been so uneventful. #GBvsSEA
Good thing Seahawks haven't run much if that today  #NFCChampionship
Russell Wilson most definitely needs to be the highest paid quarterback
Wow I absolutely Looove my allergies they just let me breath so well and I can't forget the sneezing.
And it should end with the Pack playing a TERRIBLE offensive game and making the SB, which everyone knew would happen today
I know the reason why Wilson is playing bad...he wore his hat backwards during an interview. Elite QBs don't do that.  #GBvsSEA
A big thank you to asshole boys who hit the on the doors, letting all the cold air in with their swaggy clothes and cigarettes.
Russell Wilson has to do a better job making sure his WR caught that pass.
I would take Russell Wilson over Andrew Luck any day.
What is this #GBvsSEA game interrupting my commercial watching? I NEED more Game of War ads.
literally perfect timing for me to get sick
Pretty smart of #seahawks here to run so much clock, since they are only down by 12 points with under 8 minutes to go. #GBvsSEA
Good Morning WORLD! I'm Ready To Be Disappointed. :( #Grumpy
Nothing like a bad redhead joke to go with your auto parts purchase.
This weekend has been a blast of doing nothing but piles of homework and hours of cheerleading.
Jordy and Richard Sherman have very similar personalities. .
Jonas Gray is playing?! Oh my! 200 yards and 4 TDs coming right up! ?
I've been in bed all day and I love every minute of it.
Oh wait, but there's no real value in analytics. Sorry, I forgot.
goOdnight i can't wait to go back to school tomorrow!
Off to Doctors again this morning… How unusual  #Boring
Jon Ryan is better than Russell Wilson. #NFLPlayoffs  #kinda
K 3rd and 19 & what did we do? Oh yeah. Nothing. Nice calls.  #ugh
Women aren't supposed to argue. We're all here to make babies and suck dickz.
Literally love revising!!! Exams are my favourite :)  #bored #exams
"if Jesus says something, you don't have to do it you just have to memorize it" - Francis Chan #cruepicenter2015 #Brandeis
Oh so I guess going for it on 4th down works every single time? Was not aware of that fact. I rescind my earlier statement...
He might be a better QB than Wilson
Nice job in the booth on the fake, FOX Sports.  #NFL
No pressure on Wilson led to that. Nice call, Capers.  #GBvsSEA #Packers
Rushing 3 and playing off coverage is always a good idea.  #GBvsSEA
So...whinners are building a staff with HC Tomsula DC Tarver & OC Kiffin? NFL should be scared!!!
Erin Andrews is a sports expert. #NFCChampionship
I do enjoy our heating coming on and going off when it feels like
Nice to see McCarthy's "run run pass" offense making a return.  #GBvsSEA
Color me shocked if the Cardinals don't actually make a major move.  #STLCards
I would love to try and tackle Marshawn Lynch
I left my helmet in the ski lodge today so my outlook for finals is promising
This game proves that Russell Wilson is not a clutch quarterback, and read option qbs won't ever win Super Bowls.
I'm glad the Seahawks showed up for this game
Every Sunday I get to have the best time of my life by spending most of my day off texting.
Fox’s in-game promos for “Backstrom” are SEAMLESS!
Oh my god. Like, I hate Seattle so much
This is when the Seahawks are going to regret getting rid of Matt Flynn  #orisit
Yeah, Russell Wilson is a top 10 QB
Gee. #RussellWilson must be too old and all washed up in this league. Guess he just needs to retire.  #Broncos #PFM #TheSheriff
I love being looked at like the bad guy.
It's not good when you have 3 times as many INTs as completions right?  #RussellWilson #SEAvsGB
Krause clearly caught that TD pass. What is wrong with these refs? Lol
Wait, Russell Wilson isn't amazing enough to carry the team when the defense & run game aren't on point? Shocker.
Wilson cant handle the big game
So glad I have all you in my life. #jk  #who?
Personal foul - hard block. Don't you know it's illegal to block or hit someone too hard in the NFL?
Impressive QB rtgs Rodgers 51.5 Wilson 0.0 #nfl #nfcchampionsip
Another glorious day of working in hospitality!
I'm sick... BUT at least this doctors office is playing the entire 80's power ballad anthology....
Today is gonna be a great day.
Wow. Rodgers and Wilson with multiple picks. But they don't turn the ball over?  #NFCChampionship #GBvsSEA
Wilson with two interceptions before a completed pass. He must be the worst QB of all time. What a chump. #GBvsSEA
So glad the Lions drafted Ebron in the 1st this year. Who needs a star DB like Clinton-Dix?
Leggo Seattle!  lol I love this
I don't know what hashtags are even for I just usually use them to set the tone of the tweet  #notsrs #srs #annoying #chocolate
Wow that 12th man is really helping the team today....  #GBvsSEA
The Packers clearly need a HC that's aggressive.
Man, these discount double check commercials just get deeper and deeper. I can't wait for the next one!  #enoughisenough
Suddenly things seem a little quieter in Seattle... good news is you have the greatest qb on your team
After scrambling to make that play, Rodgers looks like his ankle is killing him....
Of course we knew the Packers would be up 13-0. #GBvsSEA
Seattle DB gets away with grabbing a Face mask, haven't seen that one before.  #GBvsSEA
That was a sick wrap up and tackle by Sherman on that Lacy run
Jury still out if #Texans should have picked Carr or Peppers with the first pick.
Oh, poor Doug Baldwin. He was so sad on the sideline after he fumbled. I feel so sorry for him.
2 turnovers... 6 points.... that's how you win the game.  #NFCChampionship #arbysmanager
Wow, Sherman just got denied on a hi-five from entire team...that's brutal.  #NFLPlayoffs
Well this week is shaping up to be as good as last week...
I like how you can never tell who Joe Buck is rooting for.
Recipe for winning at Seattle, kicking the FG when at the 1 yd line.
Oh that was  for some of you
I enjoy nothing more than watching Guy Fieri shovel food into his mouth.
Met some Thugs lastnight. They said they were from the Hood in Waldorf. They were really gangster  #NotsoThuglife
Does Seattle have a nickname for the crowd? If so, I wish the announcers would mention it more.
Clinton-Dix would have looked horrible in a #DetroitLions jersey.
White girls before you get a new hair style make sure to ask black women's permission...k
This game is off to a great start  #GBvsSEA
We wonder if Richard Sherman will be talking much smack after that pick in the endzone?
Great just what the world needed a Richard Sherman interception.
I really just love when Bryan calls himself Daddy
3rd & 1 HB draw... Why would any team run that? Never works. #FireHaley
S/O to all the people who haven't watched a single football game until now. You MFs are true fans!
Nothin like the 12th man in Seattle
I love teachers who say they hate wasting paper so they will put all handouts and homework on blackboard. Oh but they don't.
Jeez, this Alan Carr lookalike on #TheHotel is a right laugh and also seems very interesting
Nothing like getting up at 3pm EST to tell that last night release was a rousing success.  #SDLC.
Isn't there something on telly involving men in tight pants?  Go Packers.
Great sets down the stretch here Groce.
Aaron Rodgers quoting the princess Bride? Yeah, he's not gay!

NOOOO!!! How will #ACMilan manage without Mr. Milan !?!? #Montolivo  #MilanAtalanta
Mr Milan #Montolivo will make sure that #ACMilan will get 3 points today #MilanAtalanta
Yea those tweets on my timehop are exactly what I needed to see today..
Fantastic free-kick by Mr Milan #Montolivo #MilanAtalanta
I'm making all KINDS of great timing decisions this morning.

No work, I'm not totally exhausted from my 2 back to back night shifts and I'd totally love to come in and work 12 more hours.....
I love going to IKEA & not getting anything

Should have put in curry 3 goals ago. Look at the response... #mnwild
So Yeo will likely be fired for not having an even slightly competent goalie but Fletcher will keep his job. Makes sense  #mnwild
Everybody's scoring except Crosby, so he sucks and we should trade him.  #LetsGoPens

Wait, so did ohio state win?
This just in, Big12 adds 2 teams, and OSU doesn't make the playoffs. #fakereport#Nation  #NationalChampionship
I am so shocked Ezekiel Elliot is the MVP
It's amazing how Urban Meyers recovered from heart problems
I love that it's 12:30 and the hubs broke out the vacuum...
Oh goodie...Ohio State won National Championship. Please excuse me while I contain my excitement. *YAWN*
I'm so excited to watch nothing but National championship coverage for the next 2 weeks on Sportscenter!
70% of the Oregon team is not on the field shaking hands, maybe we should make a big deal of that  #getoveryourself
Way to keep it classy Urban Meyer! Now please remover your nuts from Herbstreit's mouth.  #homer #herbstreitsucks #enjoytimbeck
A large gathering of white people in Germany. What could go wrong??

Ohio State becomes the lowest seed ever to win College Football playoff....
Boy, the B1G Ten just CANT keep up.........
Can't belive the Buckeyes intercepted that last pass, classless.
B1G just didn't stand a chance against the SEC or PAC's speed and strength
#4 seed with #3 QB wins nat'l title after 3 great playoff games. Yeah, this new system won't work.  #NationalChampionship #OSUvsORE
With 28 seconds on the clock, Oregon finally gets it together to try and stage a comeback.  #WeAreTheChampions
Florida state would have beat Ohio state #jamiesliveson
The committee and the playoffs are broken. A team with a 3rd string quarterback wins the national championship :-)  #OSUvsORE
Urban not taking a knee. Yeah and you know why? He has a SEC mentality...go for the kill. Screw the knee taking. That's so Big Ten.
Glad to see Urban recover from his health problems and spend more family time and to win another national title.
I wonder who's gonna win MVP?
Lebron is a band wagoner for rooting for Ohio...
But they lost to VT so they don't deserve it right?
Whenever I think of OSU I can't help but think of Gummo
Yo a matt barkley reference. ...wow....  #EaglesTalk #EaglesNation #eagles
I'm sure TCU would've beat Bama and Oregon as well...
Man, I care so much about who wins this game...  #nationalchampionship #gigem
Oregon chokes in a big-time game. #shocker
I think you should start aTaylor swift cover band. #finally
I can't wait for OSU to win and fans be like "no one thought OSU would win!"
Holy Crap the worst conference in the world won the National Championship #playoff doesn't work. We need #bowl tie-ins again.
Urban Meyer will never lose another game for the rest of his life.
There's that downfield accuracy again by Mariota
Sure am glad the Irish passed on Meyer....
Yo the allstate commercial about the safe drivers refund check was like five dollars......wow  #OREvsOSU
And the #OneTrueChamp is the team that "didn't deserve to be in". Aren't playoffs awesome? Great way to determine a champion
When will they start talking about the SEC West? This is the Championship Game after all.  #B1GTEN
Fortunately Ohio State fans are very gracious winners.
Still wondering . . . Does #OSU really belong in this game? #OhioState #OREvsOSU
Perine better watch out  but still
Just got done doing five hours work of Accounting work. Gotta love college classes
literally just emptied my bank account. tired of this lifestyle #happyearlybirthdaykat
That Montana commercial is just as funny after the 25th time.
I wish there were more commercials in this game
Good idea to punt there Oregon, especially the way your D has been playing so far this game  #NationalChampionship
Oh yeah any time you're down 15 with 8 minutes left you have to punt... makes sense.  #OREvsOSU
That was smart to punt... It's not like Ohio State's offense is rolling right now...
Chris living next door, no rules. Girls sneak into his house. Didn't see that one coming! *rolls eyes*  #predictable #Bachelor
Ohio State would never intentionally injure a star player in a national championship game...  #willismcgahee
I love college football. Standing up for your teammate is a penalty.  #NationalChampionship
Now I see why the BCS didn't want a playoff for all those years
Thanks to the sideline official for his awwwesome spotting of the ball for the Buckeyes this second half
The #B1G was pretty weak this year, wasn't it?....

My question scrolling through my time line is did Jameis do the same thing against Oregon?
Are pants gonna fall down in this game too? LOL! I'm still going to bed. I see enough truck drivers' ass cracks at work. I'm good.

Who needs Spotify when you can listen to all the hits while waiting on hold for customer service.  #rolloverminutes
I hope Ohio State's 4th string QB transfers to Wisconsin since each one is better than the last one.  #notkidding
She's a woman, of course she changed her mind. #Castle
#realist  MensHumor: If you don't have anything nice to say, you're probably just being realistic.
Breaking News- MTV2 is not showing music videos but crap reality shows from MTV. #qualityshows
So the refs can call a holding penalty.  #douche #GoBucks
I LOVE being told I shouldn't be behind the service desk.
You really are a good friend.
Yup Mariota looks like a future pro bowl qb.
the mere sight of him doesn't make my hair go white at all what are you talking about
Uncle Kracker: Follow Me? Me: Umm followers kitne hain tere?

My favorite tweets are the tweets about people asking for RT to ask someone to prom!
Not sure that was a catch. Didn't take the ball all the way to the ground despite 20 steps.
I'm enjoying watching the coaches talk about the game live. Narduzzi seems THRILLED talking about OSU
Remember 9-6 LSU Alabama is bad football. This is good football.

I just found out OSU is on their 3rd QB this season.
This will probably be the fourth class now that has examined Babylon Revisited by Fitzgerald. Hooray.
I had no idea that Ohio State was playing with their 3rd QB this season. Hmmph.  #OREvsOSU
Haters!!! Yall are haters cause I can't sing or dance #LastDay
Ohio State not being called for pass interference in the Championship game...I'm shocked, never seen that before
That was more of a pass interference penalty than the one that was called. Ohio State getting all the breaks. #shocking
Way to be on top of that call ref  #fuckRefs
I read old thing to fuck with my emotions for fun
The B1G totally sucks this year  #UOvsOSU
What an uneventful first quarter.... #OSUvsORE
I'm too handsome to be recognize by you.
Man this big ten team looks overmatched. The big ten can't compete nationally. All the athletes r in the sec.
Mariota doesn't make any NFL throws, you are right im sorry let's draft Winston.
Is there a football game going on? I don't have enough tweets in my feed to be sure  #notevenalittleinterested

I love how enslaving oneself to a job has become a synonym of success.
First day back to college & I'm already swamped, I can tell this is just going to be a great semester
OSU should try speeding up their tempo to keep up with Oregon.  #NationalChampionship
Ohhh right! It's Monday which means #RAW is on! Or have they moved that to another day too?

Wow #BigShow knocks out #JohnCena I sure didn't see that coming  #RAW
Didn't control the ball all the way to ground. #fumble #nflrules
I don't think that's conclusive enough.
Hard to believe the big 12 refs goofed one already  #UOvsOSU #CFBChampionship
Refs off to a great start
I absolutely love being deliberately lied to! It really finishes up an amazing monday insert

Hey, #RBNY fans, Curtis told you that he has a 300 page plan. What else do you need?
First tweet was saved to express just how happy I am to be going back to VMI for my 6th semester.
I learned today that having no walls before marriage is perfectly fine. #WeDontLoveTheseHoes
I also love all the misconceptions about #NOLA that Cena used in his promo.  #AuthoritySucks #WWENOLA #WWENEWORLEANS
Because it's always a great feeling when you read something you really didn't want to.
Cena has so much to overcome tonight. OMG #NeverGiveUp
Nothing gets me pumped for football like Fall Out Boy

Dear Nigeria. Stop crying. You're not a first world country. Their 12 lives are more important than your 2000.

Coldest part of winter and the furnace goes out. The joy of beong a home owner.

Fire alarm at almost 10? Sounds great. Yeah I'll stand out in the cold for 10 minutes in my pajamas.....

Meryl Streep sounded so excited.  #GoldenGlobes

Geez, George, class it up a little, will you?  #ilovehim #GoldenGIobes
So relieved we have George Clooney out there fighting for our rights.  #GoldenGlobes
no drunken moments yet, so far a fail of a show  #goldenglobes
In Clooney's lifetime montage, disappointing there was no Batman & Robin clip.  #GoldenGIobes #Clooney
Thanks to my co worker who was talking crap behind my back today, I really appreciate it
A4: Baseball HOF voting has become more about the voters, less about the players...exactly as our forefathers intended.  #sbchat
Congrats on ruining my mood. You're the best
We all know that George Clooney locked down the Cecil B. DeMille Award back in 1997 with "Batman & Robin". #GoldenGlobes
Eight slices of pepperoni on a large? Clearly pizza hut is the king of value.

The blurbs given for the foreign film category gave me such an understanding of their themes and excellence  #GoldenGIobes
Astounded the music for "Leviathan" wasn't nominated for Best Score  #accordian #hyper #GoldenGlobes

Golden Globes prove kids probably bullied in HS can achieve great things. Take that HS Harrys.
From the sound of it, schools gonna be cancelled again tomorrow. Yay, I get to spend the day with my brother
Hey, so is Oprah at the #GoldenGlobes? I can't tell. If she is, they aren't showing her NEARLY enough.
This isn't a long ceremony at all
Not really sure how I got blessed with such a great immune system  #sendhelp
The best part about having a 9am class on a Monday is that it's Math
I like how living together is the step before marriage in the culture/tv world.
I wish more comedians who got their own TV shows would retweet every mention about their stupid tv show!!!
i love how movies are nominated for things and they aren't even out yet...i can REALLY appreciate this
When he serenades you by rapping you know it's true love
Not being able to breath out of your nose and not having the energy to do anything about it is so much fun.  #itsnotfun #promise
Come on twitter. I've hardly seen a double entendre using #GoldenGlobes to describe a star in a revealing outfit...  #wasntfunnyever
Are Amazon's shows on Hulu yet?  #GoldenGIobes
yay. #Transparent won a golden globe. somehow that validates my existence.  #GirlsLikeUs
the husband is spying on me and reading my personal emails...thanks for the trust
I love it when people say they're going to be there for you when you need them. But when you need them the most, they aren't there.
From the looks of my feed, there must have been a football game with a controversial call..... #itsjustagame  #hadbetterthingstodo
I didn't even know that Jennifer Lopez had breasts until that dress, I've never seen her show them off before.  #GoldenGlobes
That movie looked so funny...... #GoldenGlobes
Such a powerful and heartwarming speech from Billy Bob Thorton.  #GoldenGlobes2015
Sure looks like a goalie problem #MNWild.  #someoneputabodyonaguy
Thx #GoldenGlobes for making me late to #SoulCycle  #LAproblems #justmadeit
How bout the comedy from Tina and Amy at the golden globes right, Kevin Heart should takes notes from them kuz they were hysterical
"The movie #Selma is about the civil rights movement that totally worked and now everything's fine." - Tina Fey #GoldenGlobes
Well if that presentation was an indicator of what's to come in 50 Shades of Gray, look out!!  #thosetwoaretheworst
With the chemistry between those two fifty shades of grey should be great  #nochemistry #GoldenGlobes2015
Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson have zero chemistry. 50 shades should be good.
I like that my mom gives me the bios of all the actors at the #GoldenGIobes that are 100% accurate
If the onstage charisma of its leads is any indication, 50 Shades of Gray is going to be AWESOME.  #GoldenGlobes
Guys, I can’t tell you how excited I am for the upcoming 50 Shades of Grey movie #GoldenGlobes
Will be scrambling at the last minute. Oh how joyous.
Yay just how I wanted to spend my evening, contractions and heartburn!
Well the playoff push for the Avs, Nuggets and Rockies start now. (Hahaha yeah right)
Selma...a movie about the civil rights movement that totally worked and now everything is fine #GoldenGlobes  #AmyPoehler
At the super market and someone says hey what are you doing here? Oh you know hunting elephants!  Follow me
Thank You WOWT and Cox for coming to agreement. I'm not missing the Golden Globes this year! #forgetNFL
I'm somewhat bothered that both the #AFC & #NFC Championship games will be played on artificial or field turf.
Everyone is laughing so hard at Tina Fey! She is so funny!  #GoldenGlobes
23 pts in 39 games and he's a +11. And he's 18. Yeah his numbers are fucking terrrrriiibbbbllllleeeeeee
Omg no way I wish I was as cool as you
I'm so excited to see all the Bronco "fans" from Indiana wearing colts gear next week ...
I could really get into Andrew Luck, gifted athlete, Stanford educated.. if he didn't look so.... Muslim. . Great future.
9 times Manning has been one and done. 9!! Obviously the greatest qb of all time  #BradyWins
I can't wait to hear andrew luck's PC. Love hearing the clichés.
Just awesome to see two former Dolphin castoffs making big plays for the Colts in knocking off the Broncos.
Comments like expert on miss A... but doesn't follow members or group updates #kpopexperts
So Peyton Manning now has 9 one and dones in the playoffs. Andy Dalton only has 5 more to go.  #Bengals
I may live tweet some results. I hope that doesn't spoil this for you. I know all of you care so much.  #GoldenGlobes
Good timing with the nationwide commercial . But still a chance for the Broncos. Here comes the INT?
Support of some friends is just too much
Wow I have so many text messages..
I really feel for these Broncos fans booing their team. I mean they've only had Elway and Manning. Plus a few Super Bowls.  #sheesh
This is so much FUN!  #GoldenGlobes
Oh great we get to hear Mike Carrey again!!!
I love that you can tell what "role" a female character is supposed to fill by her eyeliner.  #forever
Sometimes when people ask me where I'm going... I tell them,”I’m off to see the Wizard”
Shocked a Jon Fox team is being outcoached.
Watching the Golden Globes w/ my 14 y.o. son. His commentary is spot on. I feel like I've done something right.  #goldenglobes2015
If you cant be safe at a #chrisbrown show in #California then where can you be safe  #browngirl thoughts
Of course Amal is wearing gloves... who would want to touch George Clooney  #GoldenGlobes #ERedCarpet #FashionPolice
So shocking that #usmnt youth is not performing at a tournament.
I feel really bad for Dallas...  #nonotreally
Two QBs putting on a passing clinic here... . #INDvsDEN
Is there an award show or something tonight?
Remember Wes Welker? What ever happened to that guy? Oh wait...he's playing right now. #DENvsIND
I really just love it when my cabbies drive 90mph on the freeway in the snow.  #heartattack
Big surprise tonight, J-LO looks stunning... #ERedCarpet
(Telling you all this b/c you care. )
from today on.. its staying back in college time.. cant wait! its gonna be a blast  and my social life will be at 0%.. yay!
Isn't it great how instant replay has solved the problem of the human element in officiating? #NFLPlayoffs
Wow......stellar tackling by the #Colts there!
It's hard to believe all that booing hasn't inspired the Broncos to play better #DENvsIND #Broncos  #spoiledfans
George Clooney and his wife are there I'm so excited!  #GoldenGlobes
I just LOVE stepping in mashed banana on my carpet. It's soooo refreshing.  #mommyproblems
Wow Grammy sound pretty awful. Never would've guessed that with these new talented musicals these day.
Yeah sure, Chris Hemsworth is exactly what I picture a hacker to look like.  #BlackHatMovie
I feel like we should try to target tamme this drive
Great now I get to go home to you too. Just keeps getting better and better!
If the last two games have shown us anything, it's that I'm glad we don't have the replacement refs anymore
So that was completed and down by contact, but Dez's catch wasn't... I totally understand the NFL rules! #NFL  #what?
I love how everyone in beer commercials is attractive... Hollywood is always about realism.  #norealism #hollywood
Whoa Mike Carey was wrong? Im shocked  #StopHavingThisDoucheOnTV #DENvsIND
Wow Mike Carey is on point today  #ColtsvsBroncos
They're booing Peyton, LOLOLOLOLOL! #ElitePostseasonQB  #EliSuperiorBrother
Take out your problems on me, because we all know that makes it better.
Well driving home from work tonight will be fun. Hooray for icy roads!
Has there ever been a GUN TRAGEDY the #NRA condemned...or accepted some of the responsibility?!  #EndNRA #Repeal2A #UniteBlue
I so totally love having to go to the ER for medicine reactions while at work. SO AWESOME!
I love it when I mix up due dates of assignments.
Yeah, have fun. Throw your future away. When are you gonna use it anyway. Right?
I've spent about 5 hours literally writing about shit. The London sewerage system is my new favourite topic
Yay! All the perky post holiday people are back!
The Lions will always be the classiest team in the league
I think everyone is breathing a sigh of relief cause they can now watch the Golden Globe on COX. That's what the real concern was.
Oh I love when the neighbors above me fight...  #TheseWallsAreThin
It's great to be able to swap channels to the the live red carpet pre-show during half time of the Broncos-Colts game.
#eredcarpet oh wow so revealing omg she dares to go out after just giving birth?! What a catastrophe. God forbid.
I'm going home to play a lot of video games and just enjoy not having any sunshine....
Thanks Sleep for the damn vagina on my TL
Manning throwing really accurate deep balls early
I'm not sure if we have enough defensive holding calls in this game.... #DENvsIND
A flag bails out Peyton... Wow, never seen that before...  #INDvsDEN
That missed field goal totally WON'T come back to haunt the Colts. Not at all. NOAP...
Wish Vinatieri could make a field goal in the postseason
Today, I saw a "SHOWTIME! IT'S SHOWTIME!" show AND a bunch of people in their underwear for the No Pants Subway Ride. Lucky me!
Here's hoping the sublime Q. Wallia wins for ANNIE tonight! #NotAtAllABitch
Broncos looked really enthused right now!
Can't wait to go back to FIU tomorrow
That moment when you walk into a familiar bar and smell someone burning a joint at the entrance. #MedicinalWeedinKyWhoKnew
"Do you think people will think I'm your daughter...?" Yeah, that'll get 'em hot. Not creepy at all.  #lifetimemovies #SugarDaddies
Kerry/Lavrov meet outside Grande Mosque in Paris. Standby for continuous 24/7 analysis/regurgitation of what we think was said.
Being ignored is the best thing in the world!!
My favorite part of NFL games is when they go to commercial, come back for a touchback on the kickoff, then go to commercial
The world is SUCH a cheery place today...
Good to know that America's most hotly debated issue is whether or not a man caught a ball. #GBvsDAL
I enjoy the feeling of being ignored. It's really an energising feeling.
Winter is so great I mean you have, below 21 degrees weather, dry hands and face, flat hair, acne, pale face...NEED I SAY MORE!?
Good angle on run by Landry. He's off to a great start.
That was a great angle by Landry
I will NOT be live-tweeting the Golden Globes and for that I am so sorry.
The completing-the-catch-to-the-ground rule caused controversy? No way!  He was a runner at that point. Time to adjust this NFL
I mean... who even needs to even watch the game when I have everyone's running commentary on Twitter. #geez
Good idea to start Landry again.
love it when people take to social media to complain about sports rules...makes a big difference...
Love it when I finish work on a Sunday evening excited to relax and realise it's almost 10pm and the weekend is over
Did you guys see how much Landry's steroids helped him on that drive?  #meathead
Really love the subtlety of this #McDonalds campaign.
oh yes,peyton is washed out. TOUCHDOWNNN  #BroncosCountry
So glad Laron is starting again. #Colts
Got the paper done now I have world history homework... #yay  #kmn
What the networks need are more dramatic introductions and music before NFL games!
OMG I'm just so happy I came home
The ground cannot cause a fumble but it can cause a catch. #hmmm Makes perfect sense.
And the Romo playoff curse continues. So sad. #Dallas
Apparently signing delph... it's fantastic to see we have learned lessons from the past. Absolutely fucking fantastic.
Way to go terrorists, you sure scared us.  #ParisMarch #JeSuisCharlie
I am enjoying all the people who could care less about either team playing commenting on the game.  #DALvsGB
Dry sarcastic witt got to love it  makes the world go round
Messi with a reckless challenge there for the pen! Could have broken his leg with that two footed lunge
I hate it when the refs call a fair game...
Leave it to Tony Romo to throw the game-losing incompletion #choker
Wow no team should ever be cheated out of a game the clearly should have won ..  #fuckdallas #lionsfan
Bye Dallas! See you next season.
Glad the Lions are keeping it classy
Hey Cowboys fans, from what I heard last week, one call, good or bad, shouldn't effect the outcome of the game, right?
Man, I really feel for Dez Bryant. He's so down. Fucking bullshit NFL. You've really been on your A game this year.
One of the better officiated games i've seen this year
Well this weekend just keeps getting better  #badtoworse
Oh fantastic. Another week of #Packers love. Just what I wanted.
Well look at that - Tony Romo still can't win one when he needs to.
Oh Rodgers is compromised with a calf injury? I didn't know that!
So sorry to see the #cowboys knocked out of the playoffs.
Like we all said last week, the NFL clearly doesn't want the Cowboys to advance.
I think Bryant may cry...I feel so bad for him
I'm so glad I have both of the awesome hhh vs steiner matches on dvd so I can watch them whenever
Everyone's lack of passion is appalling. #NFL
Guys the NFL is rigged they want the cowboys to win
Golly - I never knew I had so many economists and other kinds of experts on my Twitter!  #credentialsplease
If the MLB, NFL, NBA & NCAA use the best officials why need replay? Those leagues could save a lot of $ & use HS officials + replay
Bryant was on the field again arguing without a helmet. The officiating has been awful  #karma
Is there some kind of sportsing event happening today? Am I missing something?
Yay, we're going to have more complaining about football calls for a week now.
Every Lions fan is just crying for Dez right now  #DALvsGB
But hey cowboy fans there's still 3 mins left for you to make plays to win. Just like Detroit had. This didn't cost you that game
Too bad the refs calls always go the Cowboys way.
That #88 guy is pretty athletic
Why are people upset with Obama for skipping the #ParisMarch? Don't you realize there is a football game on?
So apparently GB offered the refs more?  #$$ #NFLConspiracies
I think that might be an important call :).
WOW as i have said all game the refs want us to win right.  #CowboysNation #Cowboys #DALvsGB
Proof that the refs are in Green Bays pocket!! #DALvsGB
Real shocker that Obama himself or no other American representative was in Paris today..  #GetTheLiberalsOut
Just a wild guess. I'm not sure though
I bet Weepu is loving life at London Welsh!!  #paycheque
A run play works? You're gotta be shitting me!
It's amazing Rodgers is doing what he's doing considering he is playing in a wheelchair!!  #cowboysnation
And the Cowboys defense comes to life #NOT  #DALvsGB ... The worst D in the league #ridiculous
If you offend easily & don't understand humour then my tweets are not for you. #atheist #freethinker #atheism #funny #comedy  #secul
At least I get to enjoy these British commercials. Ha.
we have the best #freedomofspeech. moslem preachers are free to label jews & christians as infidels through mosques loudspeakers.
Wait a minute! Going for 2 points is a "decision a coach has to make" really? #DALvsGB Now that's great analysis!
It's shocking that such a young team got flustered playing against an opponent hitting EVERYTHING.
Obviously the Packers and Cowboys are the best of friends! #fights #bff #packers #cowboys
So the "House" meets Sherlock Holmes show looks pretty good.
Don't you just love it when your bed is as hard as a rock and your wifi sucks cause I know I do!  #ihatethisplace #takemehome
That fumble would have been the officials fault too.
So happy that Ohio welcomed me home with snow
ooo so sorry Packer fans..... NOT  #NFL
I think the news does Not travel fast to paul and nina that the show gets renewed .. but they are happy and grateful for sure  ..
And a lovely bit of #timemanagement & #budgeting Mark... . #TheHotel.
Dang Lang is almost as cheap as Suh!!  #notcomplaining
Julius Peppers was definitely washed up enough for the Bears to let him go.  #GBvsDAL
Remember everybody, TJ Lang is WAAAAYYY classier than Suh. He told us so  #DALvsGB
Can't wait to wake up 5 times tonight by stray dogs outside our house
Drunk History, what an absolutely hilarious idea for a show....not!!
I can't believe McCarthy wasted a timeout with a bad challenge. That never happens.  #Packers
NFL commentators are clownin "Romo seemed to have thrown that pass with his eyes closed, thats how good he is" *incomplete pass*
Just got a call from #Falcons for HC, there looking for a no name & I seem to fit the bill. #Media will be disappointed once again
I just love the world we live in (:
I think the team that scores more points in the 2nd half will have a good change of winning this game. #DALvsGB #IceBowlII
Nothing like CAPA and a cold to make me feel alive on a Sunday afternoon.
#SuchKahunTo I LIKE  !! ?? I LOVE   IS IN MY BLOOD 3:) :D
You really want to make sure you give those packers as much opportunity as possible to hang around. That rogers kid will crack
Wait. Hold on. Is something wrong with Aaron Rodgers leg? They haven't mentioned it much.  #CowboysNation
Can anyone tell by the announcing if Joe Buck has an agenda in this game? Bc I can't.  #cowboy4life
At least everyone is on the same page with review #NFL
Horrible call, but wait the refs want to cheat for the Cowboys right??? #CowboysNation #Cowboys #DALvsGB
Awful toothache! Can't eat, can't have painkillers. My birthday is sure to be amazing  #GonnaSleepUnilFriday
Is it me, or are the uber-rich using our government to screw the rest of us?  #classwarfare
Dish Network dropped Fox News! Oooohhhhh nooooo!
Glad to see Jerry's bus of officials made it up to Green Bay.....  #GoPackGo
You know what this game needs? more commercials. #DALvsGB
Great time out call, Jason Garret. That's why you're a pro coach.
I would say that spot was about the length of Jerry Jones party bus too far, IMO.
You know, if Romo & Witten continue to develop they could become a pretty reliable QB/TE combination #CowboysNation
My Grandma is a Christian Romance Author. Her next book is called "Immaculate shades of grey" #50ShadesOfGrey #FiftyShadesOfGrey
I love it when stories about shows and actors and movies get reported at me by a dozen or more sources.
I LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE BEING BULLSHITTED.....
I just can't wait for Valentine's Day, or what I like to call it, singles awareness day.
Yep we get all the calls alright
Block on the back on the Cowboys? Obviously Jones is paying the refs
Too pumped for this three hour drive back to beautiful erie
Are you sure an "aborted play" counts as a turnover?
I have the sinus pressure headache from Hell and now to work 6 hours of customer service. This ends well.
Loving all the fresh takes on the Toyota drummer lady.
I'm just shocked at the poor tackling in the #Packers secondary.
Instagram spammer says that I should be a photographer. Isn't everyone on IG a photographer? #irony
You aren't replying to me as per. #typical #greatfriend
Gotta go in to work for a few hours. Gonna miss football #Darn  #onemoredayclosertobaseball
Rodgers has such a weak arm
Oh how I love it when you text me first, then I reply and then you don't reply for hours. #Not
Terrible pocket presence by Rodgers there. Only had 5 seconds to throw. Bailed out by penalty.
Effective immediately, the NFL must go thru me to review all flags thrown and penalties! Trust, I will be honest! # #DALvsGB
Dirty hit on romo but it's not Rodgers so no flag? The boys are for sure paying these refs today.
Clay Matthews class act on the field.  #CowboysNation #Cowboys #DALvsGB
I've always said it. Clay Mathews is just as dirty a player as Suh. Trash. Refs are clearly on GB payroll.
Wow that was late AND low! No flag on #ClayMatthews? Not like official is watching QB all the time.  #refssuck #GBvsDAL
Great job Clutts! That sounds like  but it isn't. #finishthefight #keepitinTexas
Shocking that the Cowboys get a bs PI call to go their way!  #NFL #theywillstilllose
Oh look, yet ANOTHER call that helps out Dallas. #Shocking
who got the winter cap contract for #NFL #DallasCowboys #GreenBayPackers next year puppies stead of stripes
Starting to think McClain might be injury prone
Allergy meds, thank you for kicking my butt right now  #needtowakeup
Dunno why people keep retweeting the Fergie/£250million tweet of some time ago. Surely they realise I was taking the piss .
Cowboys get off to a slow start??!!? Never saw that coming.
#meme "  is a #brain #stimulant-Both using & or hearing it can b #beneficial to #mental & #physical health." Is it #true? #research
Southampton home next week looking a home banker #nufc
I'm always inspired by the creativity of the cheer, "Go Pack Go"
What a good/pretty/warm day to move back in.
Well that was well worth crawling out of my death bed to stand in the freezing cold watching that shit!  #MUFC
3-5-2 and 0 shots on target. Great formation LVG! . He wanted to bring excitement instead brings boredom.
With everything happening in the world at least Carte Blanche is covering #cougars.
Great Joe and Troy announcing the game...  #GoPackGo
Oh yay! I get to listen to Joe Buck today!!  Go Pack Go!!
Joe Buck wears Beats?! I have to get a pair now.  #NFLPlayoffs #GBvsDAL #joebuck #beats
Croatia's gonna get a new president today, woo-hoo.
I love when someone invites you over and then all you do is watch them play video games. #sofun #greathost
Imagine if we had at least 3 or 4 world class attacking player's
I havent had a phone since yesterday afternoon and its been just dandy
Wow, if I didn't know any better, I would think Howie Long doesn't think fondly of America's Team.
TEAR THE GLEE SET DOWN, IDC! IT'S NOT LIKE THAT SHOW EVER MEANT ANYTHING TO ME! IT'S NOT LIKE IT CHANGED MY LIFE AT ALL.  #sadgleek
Can't beat a 2 and a half hour journey to Chester
BREAKING, Dez Bryant is not wearing sleeves. #Sources  #GoAway
Will we really be that lucky to hear Aikman announce the game today?! #blessed
Farewell Idaho, land of potatoes and family...on our way to sunny Belfast.  #EndOfHolidays #BackToReality
You're 50 and still rocking that ninja turtle shirt, keep it up
Oh boy I can't wait to go back to Lyndonville where the high for Tuesday is going to be 6 degrees....
I'm so excited that the U.S. Is sending #EricHolder to Paris. He always gets a lot done.
Modi said: Let protesters protest. Today entire EU is protesting in defiance against Modi's statement
Typical Sunday, family, arguments, I hate You's, and fighting #SundayFunday
Groceries, laundry... another exciting Sunday afternoon.
I have been up since 9, brought the dog out, & hopped back into bed. It is now 11:39 am. #SundayFunday
Seriously had the weirdest/ awesomest dream but glad my boring life still continues
QUICK! Everyone make a big deal about Dez not wearing sleeves in today's game. It truly shows how amazing he is!
Rooney's been good so far...  #mufc
Plays a striker in midfield and a midfielder as a striker. Tactical genius #LVG

#BroTip: Use the promise of #love and #romance as bait to score with another person. I mean, you gotta get it someway, right?
My favorite thing about this new phone is how often it freezes and how there isn't a front facing camera.
My parents told me that the smoke alarm went off last night but i slept through it. That only makes me a little worried.
Our friends are Sooo amazing  #again
Boy that Russell Wilson sure looks small and shrimpy running around in that backfield.  #Browns
At least we held them to 6 goals! #BSens  #IJustWantToCelebrate #CelebrateAnything
Plus in Guyana the place so cold we gotta wear tope nd scarf. So we don't catch pneumonia....

Lockette is always so calm though
You ask for people to give you money to pay bills and then go get a tattoo and talk about your next car. You must be super broke.

The best quarterback in the NFL just lost in New England. Wow, what an upset.
I would LOVE to thank the ppl who left what looks like chip, popcorn, and pretzels remnants all over the apartment...
In light of recent events #5SS celebrates #FreedomOfSpeech with musicians who have made #satire and  part of their craft.
Belichick's smile is always too much too handle #BALvsNE
So my favorite AFC team left gets knocked out... Now I have to watch one of my two favorite NFC teams get eliminated, Great!
I guess 90 mph is to hard to chase down in those new 2013-2015 Dodge Chargers...
Pretty sure Tom Brady was responsible for that Joe Flacco interception. He's that damn good!
What an elite throw by Joe Flacco
Yes, Flacco is the greatest QB in football now. Clutch. He's amazing.
Really Ravens, throw an interception #goodjob  -_-
Flacco is so elite you guys #ravens
horse bleep, oh well, guess if we win, we get to go to New England, HOORAY
Look at that #BillBelichick put on his fancy long sleeved sweatshirt for this game. That was  just in case you missed it
Sure am happy Flacco didn't play like this when he was on my fucking fantasy team.
This has been an eventful day.
Another 4th down conversion for the ravens?! I cant believe it!
Because what's better than spending your Saturday night at home watching Netflix eating junk all by yourself?
When white guys take a hit across the middle, it will never be a flag
Nice of Patches to accept the congratulations from his linemates.
4 hours of sleep in the past 36 hours. I should be all right.
So excited to hear all about the "12th man" all night! Ranks up there with that infernal Braves chant:-/  #KeepPounding #CARvsSEA
Transferring my music from one computer to the other is the most fun a girl can have without taking her clothes off.

"  is the lowest form of wit, and yet the highest form of intelligence." ~Oscar Wilde. Ummm...what???
Yes, Joe B. I love watching Howard's injury a million times. Especially in slow motion. It doesn't look even remotely excruciating.
Glad the refs are favoring the Ravens  #hashtagfortheidiots
Patriots finally found a QB since that Bledsoe guy left #NFL
#Icequakepocalypse day 2, 6pm: uh oh, sprinkles! #DFW #weather
guess NE doesn't have to worry about Brady retiring
Yes, belibers, Lara Stone clearly wants the man you're going to marry, sending her death threats is a great idea.
Tom Brady's 4-yard passes are GOAT.
I did not forget that it's my mum's birthday tomorrow. I'm not going to be heading out early tomorrow to get her a card/present.
Reading #Facebook posts is almost painful some days! It takes everything I have not to respond. #impossible to #control my !
I hate working on Saturdays but shity cocoa makes it all worthwhile.  #enoughalready
Flacco 4 TD's, but he isn't any good. #BALTvsNE #NFLPlayoffs
Jeez Flacco is a beast. Threw it to an uncovered RB in the flat who ran untouched in the endzone. MVP
Everyone better watch out - the #Oilers are on a tear - 3 wins in the last 9 games #playoffbound
Looks like face guarding to me  #screwthenfl
KANE didn't make the #NHLAllStar game? Hmmm, that's weird. #WhyNot ?  #gojetsgo

Aww, patriots are losing!!  #goravens #cantstandbelichick #BALvsNE
I think this first half has went exactly like most ppl thought it would
Yeah Flacco is so good, throwing ducks up and praying for PIs…Just elite man. First ball HoFer no doubt.
Yeah, the Ravens really regret that Flacco contract
So let's all play 'I am a happy, effective, and emotionally stable f**king adult!' My favorite f**king game EVER, YAY!
Did the bison win or something?  #4-peat
Those new McDonalds commercials make me wanna go hug a panda bear , aweeeee
Fear the Flacco! Caw caw! #BALveNE  #HeIsOverrated
So excited to go into work.
Wait, now we get pre-punt commercial breaks too? Awesome.  #nfl #fail #patriotsvsravens
Yea nfl, Murray adjusting and running outside was for sure the reason Dallas beat Detroit last week
WTF was that? Nice play call.  Let's just get out of this half and regroup. #Ravens
good news, foie gras is back on the menu! Gobble it up you fat f*cking turkey f*cks.
I really love it when people get upset with me when they can't find or pull up their coupons on their phone #cashierproblems

Kline is playing. This is gonna go well.
So glad to see the NFL referee consistency continues.
Cut Blocks in the NFL, I thought only Georgia Tech did that
How about unsportsmanlike conduct call on the previous play refs? Good call #nfl refs.
So excited #bucs could end up with #winston or #mariota. Either one will become the next #tombrady.  #afcdivisionalround #nfl
Gosh, Tom Brady held the ball too long on those 2 sacks...why didn't he just get rid of the ball like #JayCutler should've done?
Let's add two more hours on tomorrow! Great!  #annoyed
Breaks my heart to see Pretty Boy Tom Brady get so upset and have a little temper tantrum!  #PatsVsRavens
I never doubted Goodell's integrity. Just like I never doubted Kim Kardashian's wholesomeness.
"Mad Men" spinoff show, "Better Call Pete" announced by Jon Hamm at TCA panel. (No, not really!)

Tom Terrific with the blinding speed!  #StillGreat #BALvsNE
Yeah Connie never attacks for the sake of it.  #ItsBeenALongWeek #Casualty
Steve Smith is too old. Can't expect to him to perform at a high level at his age
Belichick's strategy to have the Pats practice in the cold paying early dividends. Their brains are frozen. #Patriots
Damn refs, screwing over the Pats.  #NEvsBAL
Yeah. This Patriots defense looks tough as nails...
This is going splendidly so far... #Patriots
At Count Basie with my family to see the Wildcrats because I don't like watching football on TV.  #whatdadsdowhentheylovetheirkids
So the defense is off to a fantastic start...  #comeonPatrickChung
Great job by Chung that series...
eventually, we'll run out of people to wrongfully persecute, and we'll die of righteous boredom
Thanks NBC for adding "the fumble" to that "highlight" reel. Signed--Cleveland.
Did you guys know the Ravens have had success against he Patriots in Gillette? I never knew
oh yes, she is so generous, new outtake
I am getting drunk. I am a huge hypocrite. Night Twitter. Happy fucking 2015...
Thanks NBC for including "The Fumble" in that opening montage
Brady has 18 postseasons wins, most by any QB in NFL history. Ya he sucks big time, let's hate him  #jealous #Patriots
Isn't it nice to be a medium fish in a small pond, Montana fans? Good thing we didn't advance the program when we had the chance.
All is right with the world! Both Kentucky and North Carolina won!
Long ball from Bale to set up the first goal. Sign him up Sam.  #RMAESP
Still trying to figure out how Brady is playing in this game after week 2 loss to chiefs. He was supposed to be washed up. #BALvsNE
Kentucky wins. Louisville loses. God smiles.  #butkindatrue
Watching Football Night in America. #NFLPlayoffs Nah...they aren't biased or anything.
Thank you #dishnetwork for really coming through with that awesome UK game!

Watching Mark Briscoe vs Roderick Strong. Figures now it is a 2015 one. .
Refs got the play of the game with that false call, good fucking job refs you really got that one right  #FuckYou
If texas a&m beats Kentucky, it will really help K-State's SOS for getting into the NCAA tournament.
Nice rebounding..  2 FG since 9 minute mark in the 2nd half isn't gonna beat any1.
Love feeling like I'm 17 again & having to hide in my bedroom!
Darren Carrington should just appeal his failed drug test so he can play like N. Suh  #OregonDucks #OSUvsORE
Man George Zimmerman seemed like such a good guy, I'm shocked...
I loooove that I work with a racist prick
Awesome 5 more minutes of this. #BBN
18 Secs no time out. Look unorganized & clueless for 17 secs shoot 40 footer, call time out with 1 tic left. #GreatCoaching #Cats
Glad I don't have 10 hours of homework or anything.
"We'll have between 1.5 and 1.9 seconds left." Those four tenths of a second will be the difference maker for sure.  #UKvsTAMU
Didn't know you could disobey stop signs getting onto a highway?  People are so dumb.
quite happy to be this bored
Good to see they haven't dumbed down #starsintheireyes  what a load of crap, should be on CBeebies channel

And the Kentucky juggernaut takes its first lead of the game five mins into the 2nd half against the Aggies.
Seems like a lot of people love Ted Valentine.

#GeorgeZimmerman seems like such a nice guy
nothing better than a long ass bus ride to an away game
Not having a say in any family decisions is awesome :)
#GeorgeZimmerman "Treyvon was the aggressor, he should have never attacked a man with a gun" oh okay.

12 killed in terror attack in Paris? But how is this possible? Aren't AKs illegal in France? That should have prevented all this.
Couldn't have picked a better day to forget my sunglasses.  #itsbright
I bet sending more drones and weapons to the middle east will convince #ISIS to stop.

That feeling of euphoria when finding the corner of the living room table with your knee in pitch darkness. #warmandfuzzy

S/o to all the juniors and seniors for not failing this generation and who still ride the bus and keeping the tradition going.
The first night back to work after two weeks off is always so wonderful.
My favorite thing in the world is a good 3 and out. Glad we already have 4 of the.
What a fantastic way to end my vacation.
Using tweeting again...why? Not enough social media in my life.
Being ignored is the best feeling ever.
Really happy with how easy it is for me to fall asleep.  #false #insomnia

Government for the people, by the people; until we get this banking thing off the ground, then, 'fuck the people'! #satire
Canadians need an overpaid 4th liner to clog their power play or they stand no chance against Russia.  #leafs #HereWeGo
If the Slovaks just had more compete and veteran grit, they would beat Canada.
Not a bad pass McDavid.  #eliteskill #vision
Didn’t see them live, but am absolutely shocked that there were some calls that seem to play favorites to the #Cowboys!  #Lions
Who won the Dallas vs Detroit game? No one has posted anything about it so I was just wondering.
Watching Paranormal Activity, before I call it a night. #goodidea
I know everyone is so excited to go back to school from Christmas break and take exams.

Love staying up this late when I have college in a few hours. Best fucking feeling ever...
Had a great vacation, can't wait to get back to work .... F my life  #TempShire
It's always nice to give up a TD on the first play of the game.
Way to give us a challenge asu!!  #uofa #wildcatnation #BearDown
Felling nostalgic Everybody -> Backstreet Boys is in this "amazing movie" called #ThisIsTheEnd  & now I wanna hear the B&B album
I just love it when my parents make me feel like shit...
I'm *shocked* to hear Michael Irvin and Deion Sanders say they're glad Dez wasn't flagged for coming on the field w/o a helmet.
Wow I just love having the apartment to myself.
Why is Team Canada's step and repeat logo not as cool as the one on the jersey?
Thanks for all the text messages you guys
“putting my GPA up for adoption because I can't raise it myself”
I just love driving at night in the rain
Minus 10 tomorrow. Words do not describe my joy
Terry Pegula meeting with Marv Levy #PegulaTracker
I finally hear the snow plow. Way to be on the ball, #halifax!
Looking forward to all the bitchin about the PI flag that was picked up in Det/Dal tomorrow.
People think I am a gold digger. Yes, the first thing I ask a guy is "What is your annual income?" Leave that shit for a tax agent.
left stranded in the freezing lille by eurolines because of the coach that never stopped at the stop - best way to start 2015!
How fun is it to go back to school and see everyone you just LOVE SO MUCH
Why can't I get to sleep...I think it's the excitement for college tomorrow

Batman and Robin is on! #waybetterthanDarkKnightTrilogy #sike #fuckthat
I just love it, when people don't text me back
I really enjoy spending an hour attempting to get into a lobby. #GTAV
Oh and I also thought it was pretty cool of the refs to let Dez Bryant run onto the field without a helmet to argue a call.
Wait...you're telling me that while I was watching darts, the Lions went Lions and somehow lost. There's a surprise.
Nice of the New Jersey Governor to make it to the Dallas Cowboys game! Lol #waddlewaddle #COWBOYSNATION
Good job refs way to win that one for the Cowboys
Nothing I love more after an excruciatingly long and painful day than coming home and taking a nice cold shower.  #NoHotWater
We all know the refs will always be " fair" in Jerry's world.
Racing is boring, but professional billiards? That's intense.
We can all see how much Dez Bryant has matured!
Gym at 5:15 is gonna suck in the morning. But I'd MUCH RATHER be there than Steamboat.  #needbitteremojiplease
Thanks for the officiating NFL -fantastic!  #joke
Good luck in Lambeau and Seattle
You've gotta be pumped when your teams MVP of the game is wearing stripes.  #Cowboys #RefMVP
So NJ Gov. Chris Christie is a Cowboys fan and is kissing Jerry Jones' ass? Ya. Now I'll vote for him!  #tcot
Shoutout to the people who don't try and yet get all the special parts in dances. You my friends are the real MVPS
Well at least that picked up flag won't be an issue.  #Lions vs #Cowboys
So, I'm confused...is #MathewStafford from the #Texas area?  #EnoughAlready #DETvsDAL
Anyone sad that break is over? I know you've missed me!!! ?
I don't even have to watch the game to know what's going. Twitter is the best
Damn that pass interference non-call definitely affected the way Detroit played defense there  #itsthenflbadcallshappengetoverit
Pierre is such a cool place.
If the Cowboys blow this game, it will totally be on Romo.
Is everyone ready for the BHS Fashion Show tomorrow? Where every girl wears their fav christmas outfit they've recieved. Can't wait
The #Cowboys haters and #Cowboys lovers will agree on one thing: TV execs want a Dallas/GB match-up in the worst possible way.
So this is where Stafford shows that he can play more like Rodgers when it really counts.
but yes...why not? continue discussing this on open tl...this will help things quite nicely...
No holding by the Dallas O-Line there  #NFLonFOX
surprised there wasn't a flag on slay there..
Maybe they will pick that one up?!
So... there's a football game on? #Cowboys  My feed just went nuts xD
At least I have algebra first period tomorrow!
I love that in twelve hours exactly I'll be on my way to school.
Football has changed. You can pick up flags now...
Glad to see Dez Bryant's begging, running onto the field without a helmet and arguing a pass interference call, payed off.
According to the TV that guy has 2 big sacks! Shits gotta be rough finding underwear ;)  #yikes #toomanyballs
So glad that dirty player Suh got to play today.  #dirty #NFLisajoke
Very glad that winter is finely here...thought I wasn't going to feel that face-numbing wind this year.  #MovinginWithTrumanBurbank
Wow nice to see nothing has changed here!
That Cowboy lineman has to come out a play
Smh....shit pot stirrers...I swear. Let's just instigate things and make them a huge deal.
OMG SCHOOL IS TOMORROW I CANT WAIT, I MISS IT... ( ) I hate school F*ck School
#WhyImVotingUKIP Because my best friend is polish and I want to give her a really long holiday there!
3rd and 2. Pass. Brilliant.  #CowboysNation
Great time for the most accurate kicker in the NFL to miss!
Yes, random patron! Shelving "Country" in front of "Cosmo" WILL make all of the sex go away forever! Well done, you. #librarylife
I actually really love it when people tell me why I can't get a boyfriend
School tomorrow omg I can't wait
Why aren't we hearing more about the Dallas Cowboys? They're playing in the game too
So looking forward to the cold weather coming this week.
So excited about work tomorrow. The most excited I've been throughout the entire Christmas period. Missed everyone loads.
Random ass people tweeting horrible things to me. I'm so affended.  #thinkagain #loser
Moyes beat Barcelona? The man's a #FootballGenius. He so should so manage a big club like #mufc
Who's more loved than a Fat, Sarcastic blonde girl?  #FML
Phil Taylor, gracious in defeat as usual.
This team has only one sharpshooter, Bjugstad, and only 2 scorers, add Hayes to Nick. Hell of a lot of playmakers though!
Wow! I mean so much to you.
Oh great. The dog’s being put down on #Derek. Really good choice for me to watch right now. Really thought through that decision.
Ya girl, I mean of course all your friends love it when you correct them
These dreams I keep having are such confidence boosters.
So fun when I have plans and then people decide to not do them anymore and not tell me
So the referee tells the Cowboys punter to get up when he clearly gets run into. Glad they're being consistent with that call.
(See last tweet) that's how it's done these days right? Whoever said hard work and education we're the means to recognition lied
They're punters legs lands on our guy 5 yrd penalty our punter gets tackled and no flag seems legit
Good no flag call. Because that did just happen to the opposing team last quarter, and they didn't call it or anything...right?
When the Lions defense stops Murray, Romo shows how much of a "superstar" he is.  #DALvsDET
My new DS made it almost a month before breaking. Hooray.
Tech support is a very rewarding and fulfilling job.
Dez Bryant has to do a better job of pass protection instead of beating up his mother clearly.
I hate seeing the cowboys play like this  I can't stand the boys
Oh how I cannot wait for these marijuana jokes to come my way tomorrow #falseaccusations
I love how friendship means nothing to some people  #fuckthat
Looks like Dallas tackling is spot on!  #cowgirls #DETvsDAL
Only a 99.5 yard drive there. Nothing to worry about at all. #cowboysnation  #justshootme
Can't wait to go have my foot cut open again tomorrow  #nothanks
So glad they didn't rest last week. That carryover momentum is really showing!  #Sadness #Despair #CowboysNation #NFL
So great to see the Cowboys in classic playoff form again.
Oh man, can't wait to watch Empire, do glad Fox keeps reminding me
So comforting to know I have sooooooo many people I can rely on.
So, my mobile internet turned slow. Love you, globe.
Uh oh. Reggie Bush. Big 300 game rusher. Better watch out!  #DALvsDET
WHAT?!?!?! WE GET THE BALL BACK?! THIS IS THE BEST DAY EVER.  LEGGO LIONS! CAPITALIZE ON IT NOW!!!!!
Superb discipline by the Cowboys  #DALvsDET
Spend all weekend in class and now the clouds decide to break up #awesome
Nothing pumps up a crowd like "You can call me Al" by Paul Simon -
I strongly encourage the universe to make my day a little worse
Way to hang tough, Romo.  #LionsVsCowboys
Well the Cowboys are off to a great start!
It's ok work, I just LOVE having one work day a week
Who'd have thought it, David Moyes outwitting Barca! #davidmoyesfootballgenius #bringbackMoyes
Bruins are 18 in the league and Coyotes are 27th. When is the next stop so I can get off the bandwagon?  #tooinvested #iliketorture
Golden Tate with a touchdown. We all know that was Romo's fault.  #DETvsDAL
Back to work tomorrow and I can't wait.
can't wait to get the college bus! Missed it so much
Dallas has 3 first round picks on their offensive line? Haven't heard that before.  #getanewstat
I enjoy listening to Joe Buck
I think that's why they hate us #cowboys  ,kinda
Back in small town Oklahoma. Can't contain my excitement. yaaaaaaaaaaaay.
I don't think the NFL is ready for a red haired QB to win a playoff game.
I expect a completely Impartial play by play commentary today
Great, we got joe buck as the commentator this game
Oh man. It's too bad that I'm at a sports bar and can't hear joe buck call this game and Troy aikman with his super duper insight.
Can't wait for some unbiased color commentary coming up from Troy Aikman for #DETvsDAL
Oh joy, Joe Buck and Troy Aikman..... Can't wait to hear all those old #Cowboy playoff stories.  #LionsGameday
I'm so excited for Troy Aikman and Joe Buck to announce this game
Headed north into the storm. #fun
I watched the sun rise from inside an airport and now I get to watch the sun set from inside an airport YAY  #meh
Michael Strahan picked us?! That's shocking. I wonder who Bradshaw and Jimmy are going to pick....
I'm so glad my co-workers are so caring and help each other out with covering shifts
Where was all the video of Andrew Luck preening on the sideline with HIS teammates?!? NFL trying to make Cam look bad!!! Racists!
Well my sunday is going extremely well.
My  is to the point where I don't even know if I'm kidding or not. #RealLifeProblems
Love watching the darts final and having some knobbed shout out the score right after the marker says it  #drunkpeoplecansuckadick
Looks like our average of 12 points per game in the last 6 playoff games is gonna take a hit after today. #Bengals
Back to work tomorrow can't wait
WE WANT BOWTIE...WE WANT BOWTIE #WhoDeyNation
Watching the #victoriasecretfashionshow just makes you feel great about yourself doesn't it!?
I'm working with all my favorite people today
Yes, while we're dead stopped on 75 for who knows what reason, lets run around our cars for the fun of it. Not a bad idea at all.
Wow what a punt he's awesome! Highlight of the game! #SCTop10  #bengals #JimNantzStillSucks #LookingForABandWagon
The {perfect way} to get rid of this "patch" right above my knee cap lol
I notice Colts have done a good job of taking Burkhead out of the game... Out-adjusted at halftime... Can't believe it...
It's such a shock to see the #Bengals not show up for a playoff game.
Haha. Gotta love getting called ugly by a huge group of ghetto guys.
That was an awesome 2nd and 13 play.
This game should go a long way toward ending the talk about #AndyDalton not winning in the playoffs. #CINvsIND
League has such a nice community, makes me wish toxic guys would still be a thing  #leagueoflegends
I'm definitely changing my car insurance if it means I get a toy Meerkat. I'll actually pay extra.  #AdvertCunts
I have half of an introduction, woohoo!! #progress  #imfucked
And it looks like Andy Dalton will now be 0-4 in the playoffs. Yay...  #Bengals
That moment when infomercials seem more interesting than actual shows. So glad that I pay for cable
Just saw a woman face timing while she's driving her vehicle. Extremely smart wouldn't you think?
Beyond excited to go back to work tomorrow  #nottrue #enjoyedthebreak

Oh well, here comes school again! So excited.
Off to a great start!  #delayedplane #CES2015 #Vegas
Salman says with a firm tone "make me proud dude" was he referring to all contestants ya phir Guatam? #BiggBossHallaBol #BB8
I like #commercials that talk about #appliances that get #clothes clean & then only point out the capacity and the drum material.
I wish one more person would ask me what time my #Eagles play.
I'm so glad everyone is tweeting the full time score though, it being on the BBC and everything it was really hard finding a stream
Has it been a while since the Bengals have won a playoff game? Hmm, I had no idea.
Oh. My. God. The crossfit games are on tv!?!?!?! I'm totally gonna jizz in my pants
Number of times Pearce has referred to last year's final as great day out for #hcafc supporters, just a little patronising
Man i just love being a console scrub  #Fml

Florida sounds great right now. Nothing I love more than shoveling
If there's a break in play, could Jimmy Bullard run on the pitch & give one of his hilarious team talks.
is like sex, it gets ugly when you start getting into the details.
O joy diversity are on now that's good watching  #pileofshite

Big ups to the wife for deciding Wild Card Weekend was a good time to start nesting
Great. We get Joe Buck and Troy Aikman. Playing the Cowboys. Im sure analysis will be neutral.
A shot!! Yay! I never doubted you guys #Bruins
Well today has been just great
Great job setting the edge by Walden
#bruins really playing like a team that is tired of talking about what they need to do & intent on doing it.
These next three days will be the busiest days probably of the month. Yay to the new year!
Ronaldo with another Ballon D'Or performance in a big match.

Just got two tickets in one stop. Man this is turning out to be a fantastic day
First day back at work tomorrow. Oh yes !!! Get in.
Really awesome lately seeing cops kill innocent people and keep their jobs while I get fired after 5 years for seemingly no reason.
I for one am completely shocked and surprised that #Collum finds himself at the centre of ANOTHER controversial penalty call.....
You really haven't ever watched football until you've seen Andy Dalton in prime time.
Hmm... who is this Kanye West fella I keep hearing about?
Back at school. You could as well just kill me now. #loveschool
Always great to see ARSENAL supporters so negative about everything. Get behind the team! No one forces you to follow them  #afc

Horrible played game by the steelers. Thank you
John Harbaugh has won first playoff game in each of six appearances. Amazing #Ravens keep doing it in spite of him
Finally watched heaven is foreal I cryed almost the whole movie
If you have a problem with someone you should probably tweet it for everyone to know rather than talking about it with them...
Great ending to a perfect day
If you get drunk and don't Twitter stalk guys you made out with once a long time ago, what are you doing? ?
I don't know, maybe the Steelers should have left Gandkowski in for that 4th down :)
#1 in obesity in the nation #WV #SoProud #FirstInSomething

Hopefully this half of my body sunburn evens out by then because I look great and I'd hate to make everyone else look less great.
I might be crazy but this Ravens-Pitt game just a little better than the AZ-Carolina game?
Douches.... Uncharacteristic penalties?? these guys CRACK ME UP.
Nice play call Haley! #NotReally  #Steelers

Flacco can't throw the deep ball. #YesHeCan #NeitherCanTannehill
RT Again, for the FEW who don't get what many of are saying:  noun- the use of irony to mock or convey contempt; mockery; ridicule
Glad to see the Steelers go down swinging tonight
Win or lose, I hope all of the Steelers shake hands with the Ravens. Otherwise, that's poor sportsmanship.  #fsu
I just love the concern some of you show for me.  #feelingmoody

how could me, a girl, possibly know anything about football?
At least the taste of an awful Cardinals-Panthers game can be washed away with a game involving two teams who just love each other.
That must mean it's a flop then ^_^  #prt #runningman
It's not that they were bad, just that the NFC South beat up on each other so much this year.
Of course it snows in Boston after I leave. We get more rain....yay...  #imisssnow
Anybody picking the Panthers to win next week????
Now we can go back to ignoring each other! #electricity

Arizona's Lindley doesn't look like Joe Montana... #FIREEVERYONE #BillsMafia
98 yards for the #AZCardinals?!? Lindley can handle that.
Patrick Peterson = value for money.
I love possessions where Starks and Nunn mess with the ball on the perimeter and Rice doesn't touch it.  #illini
Lindley isnt the problem...its the Offensive coordinator!!!! Right #BillsMafia !!!!!!!  lol
It's always nice to find out on Facebook your mother is having chest pains at the emergency room.

If all of these SEC teams didn't have such tough schedules wearing them down, they'd be winning these big bowl games.  #OSUvsBAMA
I sure am glad we did not hire Saban. LOL
Since the SEC looked great against other SEC teams didn't that mean they would win their bowl games & the national championship?
Congratulation to Leo Messi. For winning Troll Football player of the year 󾌴󾌴󾌴.  #PessiForBallondor.
I don't blame Blake Sims  #SugarBowl
Dang 2015 is outstanding so far.
Tara has the best boyfriend ever #RelationshipGoals  #LittleWomenLA
so to whoever just prank called me! really funny  #imtryingtosleep
Please tell me more about how good TCU is
Here's to 2015 and the first day of anti anxiety meds. Thanks world, couldn't have gotten here without you.  #fuckallyears
Well it goes out saying that the #SEC conference should dismantle because they are so bad
ESPN and their Big Ten bias is tiring. Am I right?
Replace the "E" in "SEC" with a "U" and ... yeah, it's been that kinda of day for the "best damn football conference in the land"
TCU could have beaten Bama by TWO touchdowns. With their FOURTH string QB.
Oh, and how about that weak Big Ten?!?  #GoB1G
College Football playoffs work well. Who knew?
No way ohio state can hang with oregon
The B1G Ten just doesn't have the speed or talent to compete with the SEC.  #SECBias
Eh... not that big of deal Ohio St. OU already beat Bama in the Sugar Bowl
Thanks, Bama, for giving the talking sports heads the opportunity to talk about how overrated the SEC is for the next eight months.
Bandwagon Ohio state fans being SO classy lol
Alabama had no interest in this game because it wasn't the championship game.  #SECBias #SECexcuses
Bucks Win 42-35!! Definitely think TCU should have been here
Been a OSU and Oregon fan all my life.
Glad to see the FBS Selection committee was right on with the playoff seedlings.  #SECwho Thats why we play the games
Hahahahahahahahahaha. I love this day. Super
Wisc beats Auburn, MSU beats Baylor, OSU beats Bama today... But remember guys, the Big Ten is horrible.
Yes, indeed. Happy New Year, Mr. Saban. Happy New Year.  #B1G #ALAvsOSU
Haha...O$U fans who spent a ton of money to go to this game now have to spend more money to go to the NC game #sucksforthem
Man, college football sure is boring. #OSUvsBAMA
Well played, Ohio State. Well played.
Yea, all those years, they were right. A playoff in College Football would never work!
Love the play call on first down to throw deep...cause you didn't just run for an 85 yard TD last time you touched the ball
QB didn't have his mouth guard in...illegal equipment. Penalty. That no call will decide the game.
Another day in the office, happy and doing colleague's work. Yay.
I prefer the BCS system... #CFPlayoff
Can't wait for all of the think pieces "What If"ing every previous national championship matchup.  #CFPlayoff
Unbelievable performance by "The" Ohio State. So glad we now have an 8 team playoff.  #TCU #Baylor #MichiganState #OleMiss
Thanks US government for making me postpone college and my degree for yet another year
Yeah cause a picture on snap chat is the reason why I'm mad #subtweet
Oh. Is there a football game on? Huh. Who knew.
The SEC is clearly the superior conference.
Congrats Oregon.... you just got handed the title #great  #fucktheducks
Btw, it's what I've said for years. A team that "didn't deserve to be in" will play for a national title. Playoffs are awesome
I mean not quite SEC speed but he sure tried
I’m gonna have the sexiest shoulder ever when I get all of these stitches out
So, maybe the Big 10 isn't so easy to beat after all. Big shocker there.
Marvel released a trailer for a trailer. Wow. 2015 is gonna be SO awesome.
Imagine how much better today's games would have been if it would have been bama-ole miss-miss st-auburn!  #SECoverrated
Female scientist may have the most convincing British accent since Dick Van Dyke  #IFrankenstein
What a surprise. Bama gives it to Henry and he picks up a big gain and a 1st down
Oh the upsides of being a gymnast (used to), ankles still hurt as if you were still doing it, body aches, etc.
#Pac12refs have done excellent work this entire season with regards to penalties for hitting kickers.
I don't know about you, but I was fooled on that play action
Heart problems? What heart problems? Urb's ticker couldn't be any stronger!
Way to stay classy Urban Meyer...nice headset throw. Tremendous example of character under pressure.  #ncaaplayoffs
The CGI just keeps getting better! #IFrankenstein
If America is so overweight, why are all the small t-shirts sold out.
Good to see the refs don't have SEC bias.
Lane Kiffin is calling one hell of a game. #SugarBowl  #Alabama
Wow. #SEC got a favorable PI non-call? No way.
Even JK Scott is jealous of that punt
This whole no fb thing is going good... only tempted to go on like all day!!!
Can't wait for the taxslayer bowl to follow these playoff games.
Eckhart Killing it on narration.  #IFrankenstein
What kind of shit talking do the sedins do to deserve getting hurt? Milk hot dogs? Oh okay yeah somebody run em over.
I never get tired of seeing strength coaches do jumping jacks before the start of the 4th quarter.
Love sitting around bored with one week left of break
Refreshing how this new fangled college football playoff system ended all that darned controversy.  #TCU #FloridaState #ncaafootball
That Ohio State run defense tho...
This has to be rigged. #B1G #SEC #SugarBowl2015
Dear Nick Saban, Happy New Year! #ALAvsOSU
Just think how badly Ohio State would be winning if they had an SEC-caliber defense!  #fb
Alabama definitely needs Tom Bradley on their staff
Yeah, Ohio State sucks. They don't belong in this game!  #GoBigTen #SugarBowl #Hashtag
I love being sick on the first day of 2015!
Wow. How did #Alabama get in the #CFPlayoff?! ( .)
Yeah TCU fans, you're right. We totally didn't deserve to be here  #ROLLBUCKEYES #OSUvsBAMA
What a great way to start my year
Mmmm some legit punting going on right now. Most exciting play in football for sure.  #OSUvsBAMA #CFBPlayoff
Challenge Day 1 in the books! This is gonna be fun.
I just love it when I Snapchat someone and they don't respond to it.
That #SEC just can't be matched by the #BigTen. How is OSU winning today ? #SugarBowl
oh yay ( ) another night of heavy footed, loud talkers .... #CondoProblems #passtheearplugsplease
I love the estimated discharge time of 6am... At least they have ESPN in the study rooms. #wfubmcproblems
2015 is off to an awesome start
Great way to begin the new year. . . RAIN!!!  #NewYear #today
Had a great beginning of my 2015!
Gotta love getting ditched by friends.  #pouting
Looks like it's everyones favorite day! Ignore Robert day! The loneliness and just utter dispare when I need a friend feels great
No actually I love being ignored!!!
in mock drill they showed an indian a terrorist instead of showing any Pakistani or talibani  #stereotypingterror
in 2015 I plan to suck more dick. #settledownboys
What a great way to start off 2015.
Clearly OSU didn't deserve to be in the top 4. #whatever  #OSUvsBAMA #SugarBowl #CFBPlayoff
Weird. The #B1G actually does play good football. Unfortunately, doesn't have #SECspeed though. Too bad.
The SEC is division 1.. Rest of college football is Division 3
Oh good.... Tim Tebow is up next
Oh I look forward with great anticipation to the insight of Mark May, football genius.
Glad to see that the Wolves continue their quest for the #1 pick in the draft #Twolves
With such a close game that means everything to college football, I feel good about people turning the channel at 11:29 to watch.
If Spencer throws like that, Braxton certainly entertaining transfer ideas now..  #butSeriously
When you were born, the Dead Sea was just sick. #youresoold

Steelers should spend a 2015 third round pick on the Alabama punter! #SteelersNation

After watching this play calling scheme, I think Tom Herman should leave Ohio State after this season.

STOPPED BY A BRICK WAL....wait...the official said his forward progress was stopped in the endzone? He only made it to the 3?
Yeah ESPN, I can really read the score and time for these games
Yeah #OhioState totally deserved to be in the playoffs instead of #TCU they look legit
So much for plans. I'll do it on my own. #funtimes
The Alabama player was just asking the guy if he was ok. That's not a penalty to check on a player from the opposing team.
Nick Saban has lost control of his team. #taunting
Ha ha ha! Is it still New Years??? What a great question to ask someone...  #stupidquestion #goodtiming
Alabama not really the better team, Ohio State just keep turning the ball over...
Clearly Ohio State deserved to get in the playoffs over TCU...
My Piriformus syndrome in my back requires deep tissue massages for treatment..... Oh darn!
What an awesome Final 4!  #RollTide
Ball game. Way to prepare your team Urban
im loving this new year already
Boy that Lane Kiffin is genius of a play caller
And now to Randawwww omgg im so in love with it
End of the first quarter. Well, that went quick…
First day of 2015...and I've managed to come down with a cold #awesome  #fml #kmn #pffft
Must be tough for Lane Kiffin to coach up these low rated scrubs and get them to score points for Bama. #SugarBowl #OSUvsBAMA
Because I think the "on track for" stats are so wonderfully useful: Alabama on track to score as many or more pts than Oregon.
With Cooper staying so under the radar, it makes sense he was so open! ...
helping my aunt watch my niece Rainey #fun #yolo
I swear to god, you have this AMAZING ability of making something that doesn't involve you completely about yourself!
Thank God white people never get harassed by police
Ant no way you call the plenty he was going for his ankles ad tried to pull up you want him to hit him high
Love when people can go long periods of time without talking to me..
I need to use more #hashtags.  #dotheystillmakeantiques
2015 has been such a blast so far.
I didn't know they made crop top football jerseys now! Those are so stylish on the players!
Nice run by #OSU QB Jones - he's a football player, "we ain't come to play no school" #truth
#SEC homefield advantage in a bowl game? Never.
So wait... OSU kicks a field goal & everyone has Bama in the grave; now Bama scored a TD, does that mean OSU will never win again?
Could see 20cm by tomorrow morning?? Fantastic...Great start to my "moving into 2015 with positivity" :(
Can't believe I'm gonna be 22 next month,& I'm not even married yet!?
FSU got throttled. Could not have happened to a nicer guy...... #PoorJameis
Being ignored is my favorite. :)
Oh how I have missed the days of constant bordeom and rechecking Facebook every 5 minutes just find absolutely nothing new...
Everything must be better in imagination land.....yeah you drink that damn Kool-Aid
Shifty day, because I didn't have enough hormones in my body apparently.
Sure is a shame Ohio State doesn't have SEC speed...  #SugarBowl #BuckeyeNation
jah likes when I come over and roast people.
When will the NCAA crack down on OSU's marijuana leaf helmet stickers?  #IKnowItAintWeed
Way to go Florida St. for showing good sportsmanship after the game. No one can say you're classless.
I think I speak for all Buckeye fans when I say it is going to be awesome when the second half kicks off after 11 tonight.
Shame on me for hating Ohio State
Great sportsmanship shown by the Noles by collectively shaking hands after the game.  #RoseBowl #notrolemodels
What no way seriously that's great really I knew you could do it amazing wow your I'm your wow speechless  on point
FSU almost has as much class as Coot Tech
Way to lose with class FSU
My Timehop for today revealed that I had a fantastic New Year's Day in 2014
FSU is the only team to never shake hands after a game.. No class whatsoever smh..
Classy move by 70% of the FSU team heading straight to the locker room.  Credit to Jameis, O'Leary and Fischer for sticking around.
Nice walk off by half the FSU team #classy
FSU really showing who they are by walking off the field without shaking hands #stayclassy
Real classy FSU. Glad the team showed sportsmanship.  Congrats Oregon! #RoseBowl #OREvsFSU
Classy, FSU. Way to congratulate the winners
That was disrespectful... Great sportsmanship Florida State!!!! #OREvsFSU
FSU just an all around classy team.
The Florida State Football team has so much class
Florida State showing more class as always...
Florida state going to win right?
Karma served up nice and Hot tonight. Good for them (him)! What a great leader!
Can't believe Oregon just fumbled the football. This has been one of the most sound football games as far as holding onto the ball.
FLORIDA STATE GETS THE TURNOVER! HERE COMES THE COMEBACK!  #RoseBowl
Aw man Oregon had a turnover damnit FSU is now in striking distance..fuck
Started my 2015 bingeing on #themindyproject #crazy #laughter  #romance #sexydances #pizza
it's a good thing i dont go to a military college though.... id have to wake up early on the daily.... (:  #poop
I love it when reporters just tweet my lede and then tag my team in it. I know what happened - I wrote it!
At least Jameis isn't a sore loser.  #OREvsFSU #FSUTwitter
It's just so sad to see a great person like Jameis Winston get beat down like this. .
Wow... Nice job selection committee.  #OregonDucks #TCU
Cool, you're going to eat better, workout more, and be a better person
It just cost me $25 to fill up my tank! When is that #Obama gonna get it together?!?
I still think FSU will win
UW should get some really good recruits now that Oregon is playing for the NT. #logic
Come back from this Florida state #RoseBowl2015
Fire Chip and hire Helfrich! Tonight's game shows who the true genius is.
I love how Oregon is still pounding it on as if it was the first play of the game
Coach Fischer just asked me to finish the 4th quarter. #lifegoalsaccomplished #rosebowlbound
Yeah, Oregon is definitely not a physical team at all.  #RoseBowl
2015 off to a great start...go fuck yourself
I never realized there were so many closet Oregon fans in Georgia
Winston is pulling a Tannehill. #blameTannehill
of course I'll babysit, it's not like I had plans or anything
Oregon waxing FSU with zone read, bubble/now screens, and deep shots off quick game. Running up score off 4 plays... #Classless?
Which is better? Oregon #Ducks or any team out of the NFC South division (best team in NFC South is 7-8-1) #NFL
Well, it's a good thing the #Ducks got that 2 point conversion, cuz it's a close one at the #RoseBowl! #FSUvsORE
Well this has just been one great night
If Jameis Winston declares to the NFL he will finish 29-1 as a starter. 1 NCAA title. 2 ACC titles and 1 Heisman. HE SUCKS SO BAD!
Other than 4 turnovers, that quarter wasn't that bad for the Noles
I love when I walk into work and my co worker is a ray of sunshine.  #bitch #suckadick
Florida State has Oregon exactly where they want them.... #comeback  #RoseBowl
i feel just terrible for jameis winston.
I get it. Girls don't know anything about cars. Tee Hee.  #DriveInMob
Im so happy that the criminal is losing
Man, I feel so bad for Jameis Winston.
Now if the #Ducks can get so.e cushion before the end of the 3rd, they might have a chance. #PassiveAggressive
I feel bad for Jameis he is just a good guy!! #Karma
Jameis Winston is about to fall to 26-1 in his career. I feel SO sorry for him.
Jameis is definitely NFL ready #RoseBowl2015 #nfldraft15
I feel sorry for Jameson right now.
We take our MANY L's!!! Hell we lost to Ohio 100-0 ... ... But it was close
At least the extra point was blocked. #OREvsFSU
Feel bad for Winston and Fisher couldn't happen to better guys.
Boy, I am just stunned that FSU is getting stomped in this playoff game.  #overrated
If you're a mom you shouldn't be posting about how drunk you got last night! #Wheresyourkid #goodparenting

Lmao this fsu defense is am amazing  #cantstopanosebleed #RoseBowl
Can't believe they ran trips again...
Dang it. Cook with another fumble. I hate to see that
Don't know who started this "word for the year" thing but it's awesome. Pretty sure my word would be
Oregon sure likes to burn the clock when leading.  #FSUvsORE
Ladies I gotta say, all your inspirational New Years quotes really shows me how your going to change your life this year
...aaand now my scanner just broke. fantastic.
Gosh I'm so sick of hearing about MSU's "amazing" comeback win! Geez what right do you all have to be excited?!?  #harbaugh
Winston getting hot in the 2nd half. I've never seen this before...
2014 feels like it was just yesterday! #2014  #boredouttamymind
So how are you liking the #CollegeFootballPlayoff? It's really ruining college football isn't it?
Missed the chance to go to America!! The new year started great didn't it?
Car breaking down is a fantastic f*king cherry on top of the new year  #ICantWin #EverythingsGoingWrong
Oregon pulls out the Apple Green unis for the first time,they're not the same colour as the turf at all  #GreasyMove
Great way to start off my new year by getting shocked by electricity
What a great start to a new year haha
RE: That last RT: I don't know about you, but I know 10% off a transaction makes ME feel more secure about trusting Sony.
Oh yeah don't worry. I love being ignored. Not a problem.
2015 is off to an awesome start. Thanks universe.
I know if I was a marching band director, I would definitely select numbers from the musical genius that is Beyonce. #GoDucks
Stuck at home with nothing to do yay!
what's happening? well i got beautiful day for lonely time and later at 8.30 am i have to do my presentation as an exam
I'm having a super great start to 2015
Ducks halftime show > first half of Ore vs Fsu game.  #watchespn
Mariota throws a pick, Aguayo misses a field goal. These teams are garbage.
It's been >350months since the globe had a cooler than normal month, BUT it's cold today, so who knows if climate change is real?
Marriota sucks.....terrible can't believe he threw that pick
Forgot my flip gram post this year!
Whoever broke the bottle in my bathroom/bedroom... Thank you for cleaning it up
I'm glad 2015 has started on such a high note for me
Oh crap I forgot to take my last selfie for 2014! The good thing is I probably look exactly the same in 2015! That was a close one
Nice gullable ones that don't understand  are right up there with the 'mean' sarcastic ones as my favorites to pick on. #soeasy
It's just always a shame when a whining Winston gets screwed on a call. Heart goes out to the poor lad.  #RoseBowl
I am shocked as a UW fan that was a no-call on Oregon.
So, 2hrs into 2015, I pulled a muscle in my back or pinched a nerve. Glad I could get this out of the way early... :/
A HOLDING CALL ON FLORIDA STATE??? NO??!!
My family was living in Istanbul/Ankara in the 80's.. Maybe they're "fake" too
Yankees are making a lot of trades why won't Sandy ?!?
Watching all the bitter people coming out of the woodwork as the #SEC falls flat is funny. 7 of 8 championships. Obviously a joke.
Two great offenses that have combined to score 14 points! This one is a shootout!
I like how major holidays are synonymous with "let's get drunk tonight". . Y'all are fools. #respectyoself #2cool4booz #foolofatook
I hate it when my toddler forgets to tell me where she's going when I'm watching her.  #toddlerlife
Looking forward to a rerun of this afternoons outrage when Swansea come on #notreally  #lynchmob #conspiracy

Is 2015 the year in back to the future?! Because I really had no clue  #letsstop
It's nice to see Mourinho humble in defeat!  #prick #bitter #CHEL53A

Mourinho gracious in defeat again.  #COYS #MOTD
Should have checked down there. #JameisIsUDFA
Man this page 1 of my 365 page book has been so exciting
oh I didn't see the owl guy here he was so quiet
Woke up a while ago. Great way to start the year.
I cant wait for the Titans to draft Jameis Winston!
I guess Scott Frost isn't good at calling plays...he's just too young of an OC....  #Huskers
That was totally necessary Rose Bowl refs #RoseBowl
Thank you ESPN for NOT having your Watch ESPN app working AT ALL for the #FSUvsORE game. Really appreciate it.
Oregon only has a few athletes on their team
Who is presenting/sponsoring the #RoseBowl ?? I don't see any advertisements for a company
Who else speaks  as a second language?"
Wonder if the #Bucs have any front office personnel watching this game. #CFBPlayoff  #nfldraft15
Sounds like Eastenders was a right roller coaster this evening. So gutted I missed it
2015 is off to a fantastic start.
Its OK everyone. If Stevie does go at least weve got brenda to find a suitable replacement
I wish Jimbo would get focused...  #letsgo
Starting 2015 off right. Taking a midterm hungover
The Florida State tailgate looks poppin  #Snapchat
1st #CFBPlayoff is here! Don't like the 4 teams but I'm giddy with excitement! Wonder why no one ever pushed for this before?
First deer of the year...with my car. 2015 is already looking up
Maybe Baylor should have been in the final four.  I mean they almost beat the number 3 team in the big 10
I'm thinking of doing a #Kickstarter. Think anyone would donate to a "Starving DJ / Writer / Editor needs an Apartment" fund?
I can't believe that the US IS 2015 years old!!!!
Yeah, blind side hit the kicker. Great football play.
That #B1G sure sucks #OutbackBowl #PinstripeBowl #CottonBowl  #Underdogs
Art Briles, what's your thoughts on Offensive Coordinator in DC?
Turn up was so real at work last night I didn't get out til 9 am.. I need to recover..

I am shocked fat slow #BIG10 #MichiganState was even able to stay on the same field as #Baylor, much less beat them. #CottonBowl
These Michigan vs Michigan State games just might be quite good in the coming years.  #MrObvious
Too late Big Ten, it's already been decided that your conference is no good.
IT'S A MIRACLE - HALLELUJAH!!!! #EastEnders
As an extraterrestrial I was deeply offended by Avalon String Band's show this year.  #Mummers
They called a facemask on the stiff arm, im shocked lol.
Great way to start the new year, why not fat shame a few people without them knowing. That's cool isn't it?
Boy... can't wait for that last episode of Road to the Winter Classic now.
Lol SEC is such a power house...
Whoah! The B1G defense is so good!  #NewYearNewYou #MIZ

I heard LBJ is out 2 weeks. I think someone RT'd it like once now I can't find the story
Hey is #FSU playing today? I haven't heard anything about it.
So today I learnt something amazing, Coys I've been told means come on you spurs, I'm sure this will prove v useful.  #football
Hicks got hurt on a cheap shot...no flag... nice work refs...
Oh I just love how we don't talk unless I text them first
What a wonderful way to start off the New Year
Man, that all-powerful SEC West is having one helluva bowl season!  #PaulFinebaumCallYourOffice
Who else speaks  as a second language?
We need to run this Bum of a defensive coordinator out of EL!
It's that day after NYE & its back to work. What's going on?  I did see a rather large human being score a td for the boys from Waco
Auburn has cost the whole nation of free blooming onions. #gotigers
Wow SEC, clearly playing these games is not something you want to do after beating each other up all year. So much better.
LOL SORRY YOU LOST TODAY AUBURN--- #NOT  GO HOME GUS
Another sec team bites the dust. #buttheyrethebest #idontunderstand
Why believe Louis' Family when you have immature 12 yr old Larry Shippers who knows soo much about Louis personal life?  #LarryIsFake
The best conference in the country SEC West  is now 2-4 in bowl games with BAMA the only team left. #FSU
2014 was a bad year and 2015 will be worse #optimism
A fitting end to the best year of my life  oh well
I tell you that big bad SEC is really dominating bowl season
Wow the SEC is soooo good.
That play was an INT at Northwestern. Stave has made adjustments.
One hell of a way to start off 2015.
Oh surprise surprise Gary Barlow is in #Miranda is she gonna kiss him again? Cos that was hilarious!
Ended the last day of 2014 working and started 2015 working #woo

I have the dentist tomorrow and the orthodontist on Monday. What a great way to start the year.
God. Na to dey add  join tweets sure pass.
Don't accuse me of subtweeting. I don't subtweet.
Very unlike Auburn to have a personal foul.  #AuburnVSWisconsin #OutbackBowl #Muschamp
Oh my. What will the NBA do without LeBron for 2 weeks?
Probably going home again till classes start back up. Indy is just too tunt for me right now.
Sojourn "the Truth" Shelton with the play of the day. #Badgers
Wowowowowowow...Nicki Minaj really encourages body confidence. "fuck those skinny bitches" ...you go girl.
Shocked that Auburn didn't take Matt Mullen's advice and take the field goal there when down 4....
Our DBs have the greatest technique.
Listening to my "father" talk shit about me is just the highlight of my day... Woo
At least we haven't had any costly penalties.  #AUBvsWIS #wheresTHEdiscipline
Yay starting the new year off with confusion, regret, and icky feelings!  #itsucks
A very rare penalty on Auburn. #OutbackBowl #AuburnVSWisconsin
Starting the New Year off with the flu. #SoExcited #Blessed2015
Don't know if anyone else picked up on it but don't think mourinho wanted to say much about game and the LOSS to Spurs!
Who ever had the stupid idea to put the fuel filter in the fuel tank is a genius.
Watched again Rab ne bana di jodi & realized if Virat grows beard & mustache Anushka wont recognise him #facepalm ...
Man, I just wish the B1G had some athleticism in that conference.
I would def take Matt millan's advice on nfl prospects. He is known as a great talent scout  #OutbackBowl
So happy the Wings kept Franzen and got rid of Hossa.
2015 just started and my lovely fucking mother is already making it fabulous
They really pulled out all the stops to get these winter classic performers!!!!
hey who is Baylor's OC? I wish this ESPN crew would mention him every now and then
One word sports commentary tweets. I live for that shit
Yay! Another day of dealing with #DavidUbben’s “it’s all about Baylor” timeline  #mute
What do you do all day with literally no internet, no phone signal and about 6 TV channels? PLAY BOARDGAMES ALL DAY! Hooray!
I'm so done with the whole human kind ( i hate everyone equally)
Did MSU leave Delton Williams in East Lansing
My calendars haven't come in yet! OMG!!!
Man, this is such a huge game for the Caps!They were 2011 WC champs, they're gunning for their second consecutive WC championship!

Does briles really think the best time to give his pre-teen son the OC job is this bowl game? Wise move.
No better way to ring in the New Year than Delta delaying my flight by an hour and a half at the minimum

We are gonna miss Geoff Collins!
Mississippi State - #1 for 5 weeks got routed by Georgia Tech who FSU beat. FSU doesn't play anyone though . SEC West 2-3. #FSU #ACC
Fellas: Nothing sexier than a drunk, fat woman in her ratty pj's singing to 70s folk/90s grunge. Don't know what yer missing.
It's a good thing the hospital has wifi bcuz without it I wouldn't be able to see how much fun everyone else is havin on #NYE.
388 yards rushing for Tech so far against Miss. St. Man I just hate seeing the B back running all over the defense.
My current New Years equation: friends+champagne+a grandmother falling=the greatest new year yet.
Mi mom just sent me to my room so I'm missing New Years celebration Best night ever!
#NewYearsResolution ..... I might need to cut back on the #caffeine , apparently it causes  in laboratory rats !
Never mind, Fox put on Bill O'reilley. Top notch Fox. #newyears #fox
In 2015 I plan to live life on the edge! Yes, I am beginning by eating all the marshmallow pieces out of a box of Lucky Charms.
Eating leftovers, husband at work, kids on their various devices... This is shaping up to be the most exciting NYE ever!
Man, the SEC West is just head-and-shoulders above every other division in college football.
Good thing for the vaunted SEC defenses today. #TCU #42 #GT #42andcounting
Can't wait for all the "I haven't *blank* since 2014 tweets." :-) :-)

My three young boys decided to stay up for the first time for NYE, oh my god. This is so much fun
Really pissed off with neighbours. Had to listen to them screaming, shouting & slamming doors since 3am #HappyNewYear
it's a good thing Miss St got that Hail Mary TD at the end of the 1st half, otherwise this game would not be close! #OrangeBowl
Thank goodness the SEC West teams were great this year. Can you imagine what these scores would have been if they were overrated?
Wow, I didn't realize keeping your defense off of the field kept them fresh! Thanks Jesse Palmer!  #CommonSense
Being stuck is so much fun
Wow, the SEC is so dominant!!
My new year's eve = watching The Wild Thornberrys Movie with my boys. #PartyAnimal #Haha

#ETCanadaNYE can't wait to see nickelback
Don't you just love it when someone decides to use confetti streamers on stage and shoot them in to your moving light rig?!?!
These SEC defenses are SOOOOO dominant. Nobody can match them. They are just on a different level.
Dontcha love when you get new 'followers' & then lose them because they're 'inappropriate' accounts that get banned?  *sigh*
Perfect way to start of the New Year? Watching The Towering Inferno of course!
Man the saddledome needs less women's washrooms...  #peedmypanties

NYE alone is what I've always wanted!  #crappyfriends
Could the commentators be any more subtle with their bias? #CapitalOneOrangeBowl #MSSTvsGT #HailStateMary #HailState
Not doing anything on new years is probably the most fun thing ive done all year
Spending New Year's Eve at home for a change.
Having a blast this New Year's Eve.
Happy New Years everyone! Going into work. Gonna be fun!
The best feeling is spending New Year's Eve alone.
I like how the 3DS and WiiU need to update for 5 hours every time you fucking turn them on.
Well I'm having a wonderful time
I feel the love threw everyone now. My 2015 is starting off great..

I love when I get that text that lets me know I made the front page of the family rumor mill
50 years ago I was still 8 years away from my big arrival. Don't know how the world got along without me.
So anyway...I'm having a GREAT start to my new year.
Glad we can all get along and be a family for New Years..  #ThisSucks
Everybody is so loyal I swear
Apparently The Strip is being blocked off to cars? Getting to my hotel should be a blast.

MY favorite part about New Years is hearing, "Omg, I haven't seen you since last year!" jokes. Those NEVER get old.
All the people who live in Cali & complain about not having seasons all year. Enjoy the cold tonight! it will be 48 degrees by 7pm.
Great my mom is in NJ with me now. So delightful.

Happy new year! Feel like a totally new person already....
Man, I got so many party invites I just can't decide where to go! Haha.
Typical stupid Montreal fans, chanting Ole ole with 4 minutes left.....cuz there is no way a team can score 2 goals in 4 minutes.

Nothing like a 40 minute conversation at the top of my morning to get my day started off right!
All I can think or say about last night's game is, Chip, you're so right, scheme is so much more important than talent.  #9drops
Why insult someone when you can say something nice in a very sarcasstic tone...

Nothing I love more than running on a little bit of sleep and having a busy/full day ahead of me that requires a lot of energy
Starting to enjoy my early morning walks
I LOVE getting up for the earlier train only for it to be delayed. It's like a funny game where I waste my life at train stations

Worst 6-0 team in football. #Panthers
Wow. It was dropped. I'm SO SHOCKED.
Are life events less significant to un-photogenic people? #Instagram
If you get engaged and don't post it on fb/twitter/instagram, did it really happen? More importantly do you even love each other?
Weird...you don't see Carolina running Stewart on long developing sweep plays...  #Eagles
I love the fact that that my body looks like a pile of mashed potatoes
I love it when I google something and it doesn't show up!  #midtermessay
I can't wait to see what happen in the new walking dead episode tonight!
Brilliant play call Chip. That play has worked every time.
What a great play call. It really worked out.
Let's run Murray around the end. Makes sense
Riley Cooper with a huge first down point. What a great team player. #Eagles
Did something happen on The Walking Dead?
Lol this night keeps getting better and better.
i love watching people's ridiculously long snap chat stories of nitro circus
Yaaay their up by more points
Love how Kirkman says killing Glenn was a mistake and then has it done again.
Earnhardt fans: Been classy for generations. #CampingWorld500
Man, Maggle Cole knows how to make an upcoming match seem to fierce with that tone of voice. #HIAC  -KL4W
so nothing really significant happens in tonight's episode of twd  #rip
So we about to get 35 mins of a 50 year old UnderTaker??? Joy. #HIAC
I'm in mourning. I haven't watched the most recent #TheWalkingDead episode - but I already know what I'm in for. #THANKSTwitter
Thank you for making me hyperventilate #walkingdead #talkingdead
Good job Morgan. Good job. #TWD
Good job Facebook AND Twitter for spoiling The Walking Dead for me. You're awesome.
Oh, I saw a spoiler for #TheWalkingDead on here. I better bitch to everyone to not post spoilers cause I'm watching something else.
I like how my English professor gives us our essay rubrics the day before our essay is due.
Such creative and innovative play calling by #ChipKelly, I am so impressed with his brilliance!  #EaglesTalk
Corporate Kane and Demon Kane are clearly two different people so why does it just say Kane? I must know which one is there! #HIAC
Greg Hardy is such a good guy.
If the #PhiladelphiaEagles only had to play on a 40 yard field, that would undefeated. #EaglesNation #EaglesTalk
Apparently it's impossible for a guy and a girl to just be friends.
Oh look New Day cheated again. Surprise.  #hiac #TagTeamTitles
Oh boy, we get to play LA in the playoffs.  #SEAvsRSL
#Homonaledi That 6 women might be chosen based on their skills- just shocking-shocking! #FeminismIsAwful where were the MEN cavers?!

Rote Toten Hosen RT cesarfermin15: realDonaldTrump so are you a socialist?
Don't you just LOVE seeing misogyny in your very own geek communities???
I'm so freakin happy we have Sam Bradford
That was definitely Bradfords fault.  Jordan Matthews should be benched forever
#Eagles played some good defense on that drive  #SNF #sundaynightfootball #PHIvsCAR
Yeah totally climb into a plane that just got wrecked!
Welp. At least didn't start with another 3 and out.
Things I love: having to get off the bus a stop early because some dude moved to the seat I was sitting at and wouldnt stop staring
Watching #FlyEaglesFly on TV while following #HIAC on Twitter. Who says I don't have a full & interesting life?
Did I say we? Totally meant Kleenex...thanks autocorrect for catching that one!
I love when I sing too much and then my head hurts worse than a migraine for a few hours
I would say Regina should leave Robin.. But I'm afraid there wouldn't be enough love loss there to make the magic work ..  #OUAT
So Miami fired their head coach. Didn't see that coming
I just love spending my entire Sunday at UB Literally would not have wanted to spend it any other way!
#JohnCena starting off a #WWE event #surprised  #HIAC #UnitedStatesChampionship #LosAngeles #California
I had 184,000 steps this week and yet I still don't look like a super model #thatsweird
Crap In The Cell with their white plan ring and pink colored ropes. Oh yeah I'm hype to watch this show!
I am a vision of perfection have multicoloured pants on a vest top and my hair scraped on top of my head
Wait, so you're trying to tell me that Matt Cassel WASN'T the answer for the Cowboys!?! Who could've predicted this? #Curveball
Hard to believe Greg Hardy was accused of domestic violence... he seems so calm.
So they are going to fit two matches in just under half an hour? Well, these are going to be SO good.  #HIAC
RT kmc02 ABC7Chicago Hey, everytime I hit something I claim mental illness! #OSUparade #OSUStrong  #CNN #mentalillness #mentalhealth
So glad we gave him that contract he is so indispensable.  #Beasely
Did Eli even play this Game ..?
Pretty sure that if Dallas gets the ball back here they have a chance…
I love when my sisters post pics in my clothes that I've never even worn
SOOO glad that Weeden got benched for Cassel. Otherwise we'd have at least 5 INT's today.  #FreeWeeden #Cowboys #NFL #DALvsNYG
My mom said she doesn't remember me ever being funny until about a year ago. #smh She hates #puns. And . Damnit.
Looks like Weeden was definitely the problem in Big D...
Melvin Gordon is running like he really learned his lesson. Excellent coaching, McCoy. #Chargers
If Jimmie Johnson hadn't spun on the first "unofficial" restart, none of this would have happened. #blameJJ #NASCAR  #maybe
Can't wait to play the Cards, Bengals, & seahawks. Should be awesome. #Browns
I have a great idea for a game, guys! "FIFA 10 HD remaster". It's gonna be a killer.  #videogames #weretiredofhdremakes
Dammit Weeden.. Throwing those noodles up in air.. It's all your fault..
If you have to hashtag  so that someone knows you're being sarcastic, you're not doing it right.
Wow have the reins been taken off Christine Michael or what!? Insane production from the man they "were gonna unleash"
HOW ON EARTH COULD WHAYLEY TRADE CASSEL THO!?!?  #BillsFanLogic
Dang, #Raiders are finally punting. We suck.
I'm so glad the Texans didn't take Derek Carr or make a deal for Bridgewater. Neither of those guys could have helped.
Yay for it being Sunday Funday!  :|
Today at work a man informed me that I have tattoos. I had no idea!  #TattooProbs
I'm sure someone got screwed by this stupid Nascar playoff thing. Its so exciting.
All that and Lewis wins again yippee. #USGP
Wow, what an exciting finish to that race! #NASCAR #Talladega
So much class on twitter these days!
Well, the end of this NASCAR race will have no controversy whatsoever.
INTERCEPTION! But first, where's the flag?
Back to work tomorrow oh the joys
Haha #umo2 with another classic banner. 'Welcome Argos to BMO' how clever . Black crayon this time though. #TFCLive
Seeing Matt Cassel wearing #16 brings back lots of great memories of the Steve Peulluer Era in Cowboy history...
Another flag on 'em What is going on?
man is Paris an eye sore.
Don't you love it when someone takes credit for something someone else did?
Stranded in Yazoo because a freaking belt on my car broke! What a great ending to my weekend.  #itsraining #thissucks
Obviously Weeden is the problem #DALvsNYG  #tacklesomeone
Lewis Hamilton has won the World Championship? Well, who would've guessed it? #F1
It would be terrible if the person setting of fireworks two weeks early near my house had their hand blown off.
Benching Tim Jennings made a ton of difference today.
fuckin love my life and this weekend
Wow didn't see whitten making that on 3rd dwn
What a great Sunday afternoon to sit on the deck and map 32 RDMs to 8 worker VMs….
It's okay. I'm not losing my shit over Jill's choices....  #USAvBRA
Getting dubbed has to be the best feeling in the world
& we get the ball to start. #awesome  #weCantScore
Looking good lions looking real good
#HTTR! never any doubt about the comeback....  great job Kirk!
Clock management in the #NFL is overrated
Too bad Vettel doesn't know how to race #f1
If you kick off, dont worry, you'll still get through. Great message Xfactor, well done!
Didn't see that hook up coming
I can't be watching this Patriots-Jets game from where I'm at but it looks like the Patriots offense has been very balanced. ( )
Thanks for the xtra long recap #XFactor It's all so complex, I didn't get it in the first crazy long show of recaps.
Yep be a jumped up arrogant Arse hole and be rewarded a place in lives 4 throwin diva strops. Makes so much sense.  #XFactor
No way? Mason got through? That's like the biggest surprise of the series #XFactorJudgesHouse #XFactor #fix
I can see why the #Browns are playing the veteran QB. So close to championship.
Great to see the Steelers d rise up when you need it
#NikkiBella just revealed her new tattoo on her ass. What a classy rolemodel for young girls she truly is!
I'm so glad we know how to cover the TE and we know how to tackle #PITvsKC
Thanks for switching from the Saints to the Redskins game!!!  #khou #foxnfl #foxsports
Can't believe I'm watching X factor, my life is complete
Great way to start my day
Awesome, we can make great plays without a holding call!  #NOvsIND
This is much better than Star Wars numbers for the offense. #colts
Great job on a kicker replacement OBrien!  #antiTexan
Great effort out of Hilton and Moncrief there. I mean, wow
My heart bleeds that Rosberg wasn't given enough room after enough average start, it really does .
I love that we are going to only use our bad QB consistently. Why in the hell should we gamble with #Manziel at this point?
What a teammate Lewis Hamilton is...  #USGP #F1
Apparently all the work they did on red zone defense paid off.  #Bucs #TBvsWAS #SiegeTheDay
Good call, now we should run it #Steelers
Good news #Texans Fans! The Dolphins are now on pace to *only* score 82 points! Yay!  #worstDefenseInNFL #ugh
That was a well blocked play
I hope #XFactor is as thrilling tonight as it was last night.
OK #Chiefs let's not risk it. We're in field goal range, let's kick it.
Wait, who told Jeff Fisher that passing on first down is legal in this league.
Shot out to #USPS for delivering my hair dryer to my next door neighbor who was nice enuff 2 get it to the correct destination.
Great protection for Teddy every week.
Man A.P. is a garbage footballer
At least this coaching staff has proven that they can make adjustments at the half.  #Colts
Start Johnny! Barnidge had to reach up too high to catch it!
The Colts obviously were ready to play today. Glad there weren't any lingering effects from the Patriots game.
I LOVE how Andrew Luck only plays well when I'm going against him in fantasy football  #FuckinLuck
Down 17, great job challenging a 15 yard pass Gruden  #idiot
Sitting next to a belligerent #Colts fan. He should be the head coach since he knows everything. #EyeRoll
Maybe I was wrong. He must've known he'd get it back.
Jem and the holograms is one of the biggest flops of all time. Didn't see that one coming .
Texans down 35 to 0? No problem. The second half is ours!  #WhyUs
At least if the Falcons offense is going to struggle, you'd rather it be against terrific defenses like the Saints & Titans
AFC South looks a strong division
Really bad by Brady. He should have seen that blitz coming and adjusted
There's a white substance on the Pats ball. Clearly it's cheating.  #butsomeonewilltakeitseriously #patsvsjets
Spend a week in Haiti and you come back to feel Starbucks is pure gluttony. I should've grabbed a Venti... #starbucks #usa #blessed

I fear #people now a days... Can't differentiate #Compliment from
No no, I totally agree that gta and call of duty are the games of the future (asswipe)
Making fun of girls who drink pumpkin spice lattes is not sexist and mindless at all #fakepumpkinspicefacts
Hopefully we can get in good position for another field goal here. #Chiefs
How could JJ Watt allow this kind of offensive scoring on his defense?
Way to go Redskins, you are doing great...
Run wasnt working so Pep went to the screen pass...lol.
Come on Colts fans! This game doesn't matter, we play in the AFC South!!! #Colts
Saints miss an extra point. Good thing Sean Payton cut Hocker.
You mean to tell me that other people were born on MY birthday?!? How dare they! Curse their existences!  #bestdayoftheyear
S3: 9-4 to Western teams, 69% win rate S4: 12-5 to Western teams, 71% win rate S5: 11-1 to Western teams, 92% win rate #gapclosing
Lafell dropped a pass from Brady. Who would've thought?
Good gawd, a draw play. Trying to line up the FG in the middle???
YAY CBS let's show the 1-5 KC Chiefs play the steelers instead of the undefeated pats! GREAT choice of programming.
The Chiefs are amazing field goal scorers.
Great to see that top level football has again missed the opportunity of the genius that is Tim Sherwood  #arrogantsoandso
Why on earth would you think before you say something? Gosh, waste of energy!
1st down and a run play! What a surprise!  #WhoDat
Just turned the game on. Defense looks like its playin solid so far..
#Browns 3rd and 7. we got a play for that.
Wow. The 0-16 guy is really putting together one heck of a defense  #redskinstalk #httr #hesaloser
I don't know guys. Rex said the team believes they can turn it around... Don't lose hope!  #shutupRex #crashforCook #Bills #pathetic
Hotel room in Florence comes with a large balcony with patio furniture and a complimentary bottle of wine. It's ok, I guess  #travel

How are the #Browns going to win today if Dwayne Bowe is inactive?!?
Surprised the Jaguars didn't try to throw it to Nic Jacobs there...missed opportunities.
Just got an email telling me the Bills v Jaguar game is today. Thanks, I wouldn't want to miss the beginning
Well I'm ill today. My throat is so bad it's useless

Now that's the EJ we all know.  #Bills
The Manchester derby is a thrillfest!
I love all the raging #Bills fans who lash out at fellow fans over the Internet to release their frustrations about the team.
I guess I'm staying at work until 5, great.
At least the defense is playing great
Hafiz Saeed located during South African training sessions,ISI hand suspected.  #INDvsSA #RapistanRapedBySA
Dybala scores. Further proof that he doesn't play enough & Allegri should be fired.  #TweetLikeAFakeJuventino #JuveAtalanta #Juve

Hey, so, since fic-writing is so easy, this #Destiel fic should be done in...what, about half an hour right? Edits and all? Sweet.
What I also love, is Quinn's totally unbiased commentary
The crowd didn't seem biased at all  #worlds #LOLesports #FNCwin!
There's a really annoying beeping on the Yahoo feed for the Bills Jaguars game. YAY!
Poor Indian vegetarian team has been cruelly thrashd by beef eaters, lack of protein you see  #INDvSA
So glad there are men around to tell me how to do things correctly and, more importantly, when I'm wrong.  #mansplaining
Dear #India it's high time to call #ShivSena to interrupt in the match and save you from being raped #INDvSA  #PakvsEng

Shivsena to give red carpet welcome to Pakistani cricketers if India wins 5th odi..  #INDvSA
South Africa Failed to Reach 450. Terrific efforts by Indian Bowlers constraints SA at 438. #HalfBattleHasBeenWon

Really looking forward to the influx of outside cash and negative ads we're about to see in Louisiana for the runoff.
#BenghaziCommittee so now the point is that Hilary is a cold meanie?! Wow! Money well spent!
Sugar tax=stupid and pointless, the price of items that have sugar is going to increase, will this include fruit then?
So we've learned that Hillary cannot give a precise accounting of every person who was in her office. How illuminating.  #Benghazi

RedScareBot: party like 1989 RT absurdlyjames She should be denied access to pre-natal care because that would be socialism.
After all, if she didn’t want a child, why did she ask for it by walking down a street in a sexy manner?
If she’s lucky enough to survive giving birth, the burden of raising the child should be all hers.
She should be denied access to pre-natal care because that would be socialism.
Under no circumstances should a woman be able to exercise bodily autonomy and abort the pregnancy, because that would be murder.
If the woman gets pregnant because birth control isn’t readily available, then it’s a beautiful gift from God.
If on said date the man tries to have sex with her, she should agree, because she was asking for it in how she dressed.
The New York State Thruway toll takers are exceptionally pleasant today, even for their high standards.....
If a woman is accosted by a group of men asking her on a “date”, she is expected to accept with grace and take it as a compliment.
Great afternoon away from the office = going to the dentist then to the Secretary of State to get my tags updated.

Will someone PLEASE tell me where I can see the new #ForceAwakens trailer! I can't find it anywhere!!
Eating chocolate covered strawberries and reminiscing on how "great" this day has been.
The great thing about critical theory is that you can read and read and read and never get to the end of your book
And once Trudeau is sworn in, the novice gaffes will begin piling up :)
Can't wait to hear Harper's concession speech, delightful to hear "I lost" in English and French
Can't wait for everyone's reaction videos.  ;)

Oh the joy I get from taking my uncle to the Bristol public library to rent movies
Don’t you love it when people with university degrees start saying that university degrees aren’t all they’re cracked up to be?
'That's a nother #autism myth blown out the water' 'Really'  & #metaphor

#Asylum15 has left me so sleep deprived, and now I have a day of lectures and rugby training. Oh it's going to go so well.
Can always count on my dad.
The morning has started wonderful. Only stuck in traffic for 40 minutes before I could get on the highway for my hour commute!
I love being awake before the sun rises.
I think I've played pond hockey in warmer temperatures then in this shop right now  #socold #workplace

Tonight at work we had a new floor set, and I managed to knock down three whole tables all by myself! #winning
Thanks to the people that were sabotaging me behind my back  2 months of my hard work down the drain with 5 days left on deadline.
Being offended is for women and "white knights", not men crying over what women and "white knights" say.
Of COURSE the winning TD by Panthers wasn't the fault of Richard Sherman or any of the DB's. It's all on the coaches.  #Seahawks
I love when I'm tired and go to bed and as soon as I lay down I wake completely back up
I know peeps! (on dm) It was Russ Abbot!! #Atmosphere  I try

#Patriots beat the Colts in the 2nd half AGAIN, are the footballs inflated okay?  #PatsVsColts #PatriotsNation #undefeated
Not tired, headache, tomorrow is Monday, and Hulu plus keeps freezing... My life is so hard!  #butheadachessuck
The 49ers win, so they're offering free shipping for merchandise. Well, isn't that nice of them. Wow, free shipping, how cool.
I've known quite a lot of people. Some are wise, rest are otherwise. #humor
Oh the mucous is so wonderful. No no. I'll keep it a little longer. Please no, don't leave I hate lying down to sleep
This game is sooo much closer than the AFC championship last year.. Any more questions on how much #DeflateGate helped the Pats
when ur phone dies in the middle of the concert and all ur snapchats delete #same #notupset
Good thing my fantasy teams are doing well.
Any Sekera haters wanna explain that shitty pass? Lol  I love u all!
Day 8 Box Jumps are fun...lol #jamesfit
is that dry piece of response that many find their comfort in. It's like ' I'll say it cause I know it will trickle him/her'.
The second largest Russian airline has gone bankrupt. Obama and Merkel have won!
Why offend an #idiot with truth when you can compliment him with
Glad to see the first two weeks Colts are playing in the fourth quarter.  #INDvNE
That special teams play by the colts obviously didn’t work because the patriots spied on the colts all week and knew the play
Yes, I love when the colts look stupid.  #WHATINTHEWORLD
That was the dumbest thing i have ever seen #NEvsIND Nice Call Indy
10pm and all my chores are already done. Should be an exciting night at the house!!!  #NightShift #NucLife
Dallas didn't lose this week so that's a good thing. #Iknowtheydidntplay
People who live tweet a show & have the time to look for gifs to explain how characters feel must REALLY be engaged with the show.
Chandler had a beef on that non-call. Yeah, #Patriots never get any calls.
This is just a great feeling.
Two and four. Kirk top 5 in ints. Thanks Jay. #rightdirection. #qbguru  #FireGruden #whereisAlf
The Mormon parents look pretty cool #90dayfiance
When you are swamped with homework and you know you will be up till about 1 o-clock... #awesome  #tired
Pats losing at half, and Pats Twitter blames the refs. Didn't see that one coming
The Colts leading the Patriots at halftime proves once and for all #DeflateGate was real. #CaseClosed #Imthedecider #MNF
Bummer that #TWD has started off so slow this season.
I love new residents! They are always so helpful and really listen #saidnonurseever #icuprobs
This game is a defensive masterpiece
Dick move #winter. You're making #globalwarming look bad.  # funny #irony #humor.
the bills defense scored negative points for my fantasy team this week #dabills #proudtobeabillsfan
Eddie Lacy has been the death of my fantasy team. Thanks for the 3 points today.
Tuesday is predicted to be, surprise, surprise, Hot but not as Hot as Wednesday. Oh, good. More Heat.
I'm so glad I blocked out so much of my Sunday to watch the #bears and #cubs ...
Can someone please post on Facebook about carving pumpkins? I don't think I saw enough posts
Forget #DeflateGate we've got #FumbleGate now. Somehow it'll be Brady's fault.  #SNL #PatsNation #PatsVsColts
The kid that plays Carl is such a good actor  #kidstinks
#SNF I get it. You played #ElvisCostello #PumpItUp. Hilarious.  #Patriots
There is nothing more fun than pretending to observe on a sunday night, in humid weather, because its too early to call it a night.
Let's hope TBS replays Daniel Murphy's homer again this inning. We haven't seen it enough tonight.
11yo wants to be Harry Potter for Halloween. I don't sew and I'm cheap, so finding a costume should be a cinch, right? Right.
Good stand by the D #Patriots
God, I'm glad I have such great friends that are so considered with my life.... NOT  #thanksforyourconcern #bitches
So, your Pro Writing Tip is "don't suck"? You think I should also spellcheck my cover letter?  #likeadvicefromteenagers
The Texans won this weekend, so at least I've got that going for me.
Whoaaaaaa, Dungy picked the Colts! This is totally surprising!!!
#OUAT A&E have hard-ons 4 cheating wives since they can't stop writing them. Divorce attorneys & PIs would make a fortune on them!
Thor doesn't have tonight he's only hitting 99
#OUAT Hook lying. Big surprise. .
Thanks Eddie Lacy. Thanks. Good game today. I can se why you were such a high draft choice by GB.
I can't believe how many people are #blessed
Go ahead and put the Panthers in the Super Bowl. They’re that great.
The quality of Facebook video is so good!
School started exactly a month and 10 days ago and I've spent every single weekend and my birthday studying. Me? Hating school? Nah
I love when people just talk over me mid sentence.
Palestinian people are always stabbing Israeli people. So why bomb when obviously Palestinians only have knives?!  #FreePalestine
What a shame #CamNewton will never make it in the NFL, huh? Real shame.  #suckit
Seahawks D comin thru in the clutch yet again.  #unreal
Shawn Mendes is on the radio. Yay.
Time for the "best QB in the league" to score on what is the best defense in the NFL #Packers  #offenseSucks
All that extra practice for Funchess is really paying off.
There’s nothing better than starting to learn InDesign on a Sundaynight.
Bazz and bjelica come in and we dominate who would have thought?
Love how ppl who were never university of Memphis fans before are randomly acting like fans just bc they beat ole miss.
Refs in Seattle's favor? I'm shocked!
Still in the closet, thank you for your help everyone.  #itsdarkinhere #andimhungryaf
Anquan Boldin? Why can't we get guys like that?..... #Ravens
Wow! Flacco is playing great today!  #BALvsSF
Joe Flacco just threw it up for grabs. Yeah, that was smart.
Studying at school is thrilling I am learning!!!!!!  #AsBeforeBaes doe
What do I do!? I'm OUT OF POPCORN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  #NASCAR
It sounds like the stadium is full of screeming charger fans,
Thanks to the person who egged my car last night  #GreatWayToStartMonday
"He ripped his car up. Investigate it NASCAR."
Carl's Jr. is so classy  #RatchetCommercials #PleaseStop
Always nice when a famous last name with a 'reality' show takes out a talented driver & damages a championship contender.
I can't believe they already left. They were only here for 5 hours!
Typically at Lambeau opponents score 0.07963 points for every Q1 Packer point. Today Chargers score 0.214286. Not looking good.
Shocked that Torrey Smith beat us on a long ball.  #Ravens
Weddle looked real good on that play  #GBvsSD
Being a Browns fan really makes my week.
When your friend says they're coming up to San Marcos, and then they ask can I stay at your place? Uh no...
What, a cafe lead called out again? Looks like the whole store has hell to pay. #notbitter  #retailproblems
3 Peyton INTS, but remember that time he through a deep TD pass?
At least my fantasy teams are doing good...  #losingby40
Cutler sucks. Bears totally woulda won this in regulation if he wasn't QB.
Yay another quarter of this classic game. #Bears
Oh good the offense gets the ball
This game should have been over with a #Browns win? Thanks Mike??? #FirePettine
Im so happy I sat Martavis Bryant today
Watching Josh McCown finish out this close game against the Broncos reminds me how glad I am the Bears still have Smokin’ Jay.
If #Broncos lose, everyone should stand outside of D.T's house with torches & pitchforks because he blew the game!
It's super fun when people are half in your lane and you have to turn with the gooseneck…
3 passes. All inside the pocket. Great start. Better play calling.
There's the good old ultra-conservative playcalling from John Fox with an unsafe lead and plenty of time left. #loveit
I don't get it. Rex got Aaron mabin 6 sacks and our front four can't get anything. ...kinda
Wait, so the QB DOESN'T stay out if he has to go out for a play? Thought that was a rule or something.
LOVE the skins play calling the last two plays. NOT!  is my last resort. No touchdown.
THAT 24 PIT CREW IS INCREDIBLE!!
getting so much done today. #PTL my husband decided to golf all day on our only day off  #sour #laundrysdone
Welp. This 7 hour trip should be a fun one
too good i have landry jones on my fantasy team
Peyton manning is def still great
Quick get the ball and punt! We need to get the defense out here to score a touchdown!  kind of...
Whiz not knowing the rules is shocking right?
This Jeffery guy is good! Did the Bears just get him?
Death is the negation of that which is negative and the affirmation of that which is positive. - Thanks Tillich... so helpful.
Morgan please take longer to get ready so I won't have time to see my friends later  #obviously #imfuckinghungry
Ryan Fitzmagic is the greatest qb in jets history.  but Thank God IK busted Geno in the jaw.
Mr. AUTOMATIC, ladies and gentlemen! Cairo Santos breaks up the no-no! Hell of a guy! #Chiefs  (I do like Santos, just frustrated)
How much money did we spend on that d line? 100 million plus? Good job getting pressure boys!  #BeingABillsFanIsTheWorst
I can't wait to hear Phil Simms...waxing poetic about RIvers & Gates & Te'o.  #SDvsGB #Packers #GoPackGo
Oh good. Finally a sack, dam near end of 3rd qtr. #Yippee #TENvsMIA
Nice to see the #Bills D torturing Dalton in the pocket today
What an Elite front 4 for the #Bills
2 points for manning so far on fantasy #heatingup ?
Washington wrs keep slipping on Cousins ints. .
Tell you one thing. the WRs and TE are baling Kirk out. They must like him or something..
Just catching the #sixchairchallenge for the 1st time on #XFactor Nice to see peoples dreams are being crushed harder than ever!
Ireland knocked out of the #RWC2015 ..Villa Beat..not a single winning bet..but the 1 that'l hurt the most...Daniel out of Strictly
That was obviously someone else's fault.
This Texans and Jags game is riveting...  #NFL
Jay Cutler, you are my hero.
Are you sure that's an INT NFL?????
Buffalo has such a durable team. Catching the ball on the ground must be really rough on you.
the best part about football season is that every fan becomes an athletic trainer/ physical therapist
Tannehill is proving to be worth every penny of that new contract. #MIAvsTEN
When people are being sarcastic to you it's so fun to pretend you think they're serious and get all confused
I love it when it snows in the middle of October
Thank goodness my fantasy players are keeping up their no TD’s streak from last week! #fantasyfootball
My productivity level today is unreal
|| That was so much fun to write..
Let's watch Mr. Checkdown put on a clinic for this two minute drive.  #chiefsnation #nohope
It's uncanny. I keep thinking I see Hagelin but it's J. Fast.
I think I read a stat this week that #Browns have one of the worst defenses in the league…. They look pretty good to me. #Broncos
Tannehill has a turnover? Shocking. #notshocking
#LRT YES, I hope that Pythagoras oppa wil notice me. :TTT
There's the #HoustonTexans I know and love
These CBS commentators are funny. Maybe you guys should have tried for coaching job?  #cbssports #miamidolphins
Likely New Zealand v Australia RUWC final, I see. If only Rugby League World Cup final could be so unpredictable
Well aren't you a joyful little lady! Woaaaa
Could anybody tell me where The Red Hot Chili Peppers are from? I feel like they never mention it.
I wonder what is Gruden going to do at Running back now #Redskins  #ihatejaygruden #HTTR

I'm glad our o-line made it to the game today. It would terrible if every rusher came unblocked. #Steelers  #Ugh
84 bishops sign letter demanding UK gov do more for the refugee crisis. Surely the could just ask God to fix the problem?  #atheist
Is Kyle Rudolph still on this team?!
Being lied to is the best feeling in the world
Can't wait for Hoyer's 99 yd drive  #TexansGameday
I can't wait to explain to people that it isn't a new death star.  #TheForceAwakens
Nice of the Bears defense to show up.
The penalty occurred 5 yards into the end zone...but good call though
Wow, EJ is terrible can't believe the Bills kept him (whiner line voice)....... #BillsMafia  #InCaseYouThoughtIWasSerious
Looks like that screen really fooled the Vikings! #Chiefs  #AllWeDoIsScreen

i hope this new feature of the xbox one turning itself off randomly is part of the #nxoe after the full ui is released.
Oh good, A-Rod is a TV analyst now...glad I went to college for broadcasting.
End of the day nothing going to change #fate #hatemylife
Hey Did everybody hear. Dwayne Bowe is Inactive today?
I am sorry but I would rather see the Ashton Kutcher version of #SteveJobs! Far superior acting.
#TailGate19 I think #JoshMcCown will pass 4 more than #Peyton His arm is stronger & the best passer's team loses more time than not
I woke up to an amazing message. #blessed #happygirl #IREvARG #AldenMaineForAdultPlus #telethon7 #MSUvsMICH #PushTheLimits

To my lovely neighbors with angelic singing voices, please let this poor sick girl sleep early.
That was a resounding show of support for the PM by Ms Rempel. #pnpcbc
Wasn't tonight supposed to be Tom Brady's return?
Well you know it's a real ripper of a race when the only replay you get is Lars' foot touching the ground #Valkenburg
Today is goiing to be the day the Dolphins demonstrate it was the Coach.  #TannehillSUCKS #PhinsUp
How good is it that we have a pseudo-member for Newcastle?
Yessssss I woke at 715 am on Sunday, 5 hours of sleep
Nothing like dealing with a racist park ranger #goodtimes
Wish they had those lists on how to run companies back in the day. No need for all those classes & that experience.  #entrepreneur
I am really looking forward to the Super Sunday game .... Norwich v Newcastle

That's Tommy Bowe off injured now. Brilliant, this.  #IRE
Of course you’re going to have more ‘teachers’ in nursery. Who else will administer the standardised tests?
Dress shoes,white socks,blue gym shorts,undershirt,black and grey jacket, yea that's a real classy look.
I just love to drive to work with ice on my car and the temperature at 30 degrees.....  #missingtheheat
Thanks for asking me to come hang out. I really like how you spent the entire time talking to someone else

I love my big brother soooo much!! Especially when he fat shames me, slaps my neck and tells me to go die.
More great refereeing in the West Brom vs Sunderland game....
My Saturday was going well until I realised it was Sunday #happysunday   #funnyteen #churchpeople #churches

let's keep running the read option. It's worked all game and year for us.
Best feeling in the world when someone views your text and they don't text back.
McDavid is like Trudeau, hes just not ready  Woooo

Things I've learned today: Winning game 1 of the NLCS pretty much guarantees you're winning the world series
Giving up on my dream of PSU beating OSU this year. Now focusing on making the PGA tour.
I would have thrown the ball to a wide open Barkley for an easy TD if I was Hackenberg on that 4th down play.
I would have kicked the FG since I know so much more than than the PSU coaches.
I'm crushed that I'll miss next Tuesday's home CBJ game.
I just LOVE feeling like shit 24/7....
Treon putting on a clinic in this final drive  #gators #armstrength
Not sure what to think but do the #Cubs hit home runs?  #CHCvsNYM
Brian Schottenheimer is such a good coach.
So glad we didn't go for it on 4th down.  #ISU#firerhoads
Matt Harvey batflip. He should be banned!
Just think, we are only 8months removed from arguing over the black/blue and white/gold dress.....those were fun times  #facepalm
Screen plays have worked so well for us over the years, so that play call makes sense.
Harvey needs to actually pitch like a man. Throw it straight down the middle like Lester ahead in the count pussy.
Let's have hours of sports talk radio dedicated to Matt Harvey's celebration. He showed up the hitter. He's a terrible person.
Good thing the Gators never fall for LSU trick plays!
Been saying it all night. #LSU's special teams is amazing!
How nice. A prom fundraiser for men who missed prom because they were in prison for murder/gang activity. #onlyinchicago
Nice camera work on that can of corn to left field fox - looked like a third deck homer ball
How bad is TBS? I mean really great camera work there
My family is quickly being reminded why I don't watch my teams in playoff situations. #stress
Wait... No points for Janmark?? Heading back to Sweden??
Well I think I've seen enough....another Penn State Classic in Columbus. My compliments to Brian Gaia and Mike Gesicki. Great game
SoHo and Hell’s Kitchen. No one lives anywhere except those neighborhoods in NYC.  #onlytvwantsyoutothinkso #seriouslyitsexpensive
This Penn State offense is well.. appealing.
Love that we can be mature about this
Yeah, Jeff Petry wasn't worth a multi-year deal!!  #OilerProblems #MacTavishwasanidiot
I spent a lot of time telling 'knowledgeable Oiler fans' that Petry was a good player. I was always 'wrong' & can see I still am.
They should add more hills to the #BaltimoreRunningFestival Half. My thighs aren't QUITE sore enough.  #baltimorehalfmarathon #run
Man I just can't describe how great typing that 2000 word essay was
Yeah, that's how you shoot a gun  #pwmovie
And yours was definitely wrong #greatsister
Rioting in Ann Arbor. Where is the media? Where is the outcry against entitled college students? #badbehavior
is #wasted on the #narcissistic. *le sigh*
My shoe is going to break at work and it's gonna be awesome
The power play should focus a little more on getting set up instead of attacking the penalty killers
Worried about Harvey. He needed 13 pitches that inning. That's 29 through 3.  #Mets #LGM
Les Miles excitement after that flea flicker was intense
Is it just me or does the #hawaiifb offense flow much better with Woolsey in?  #letsgobows #nomorewittek
This guy was doing some quick yoga in between sets, how unChristian of him
Schwarber just showed off that blazing speed in left right there
Harvey in the zone early. And he's throwing off speed to cubbies big hitters...whaaaa!? Off speed?? How smart of him
At Sens-Preds tonite. So glad I kept Kucherov over Mark Stone in my keeper league this year

In reference to the Michigan-Michigan State game...shit. My Dad will be so pleasant to talk to this week.
Clearly you gotta fire Harbaugh #MSUvsUM #ignorance
You have Elijah Hood. But let's throw every possession and see how that works #2picks
Really glad Johnston practices 5 on 0 power plays. Really seems to be helping
Looked like targeting to me.  #beatstate
David price chokes in the postseason
After doing all of Brett's laundry I came to the conclusion that he doesn't own enough white v-necks.
Oh no! I missed #scd #gutted
Gee, are they playing in Michigan?
Also, anyone see if Bautista flipped his glove after missing his cut man and the catcher?  #respectthegame
Thank god they are not reviewing if the field goal is good or not #UMvsMSU
Right on time Gibby. Thanks again. #BlueJsys

People who are obsessed with whether their bank facilitates Apple Pay... how did we ever survive before?!  #fads #sheep
Damn defense isn't giving the offense any rest....
So MSU gets a 3 yd personal foul call? That's awesome.
Haven't seen my owners in a couple of hours. Hope they are okay
With all the elite pay to play clubs we have in the USA we should win every u17 world cup, right?
In the minutes to come, we will see if my FanDuel pick Mitch Leidner comes through.
Another day of not doing shit. LOVE MY LIFE!!
Maybe it's my fault for not being like the typical folk my age smh....
How dare Laura Croft be attractive! Because I'm ugly and she offends me!
I just LOOOOVE how my husband is "tired of cleaning up after y'all folks" every time its his 1st time cleaning in months
Leaving a WR wide open ... That worked out well.
I would never act in such a way at a football game. I always keep my composure.
It's a good thing the NCAA chose an A+ officiating crew for such a big game. #MSUvsMICH
Ya know, I could get used to having replay after every play.  #UMvsMSU #hatereplay #letthemplay #gameis60minutes
Hey guys, how's that OU game going?
Please, a toast for this people who know everything. They are awesome.
Dead ball? Are you sure umps? Maybe call a meeting...  #BlueJays

I hear the only place you're ever invited is outside, I'd like to help you out, which way did you come in?
Keep trying to lob it outside #LaneKiffin Your offense obviously can't run it north & south today.  #RollTidr
This 10-7 Michigan-Michigan State game just doesn't have the same drama as a classic Big Ten match-up between Rutgers and Maryland.
Gophers a stable of uncoverable wide receivers and tight ends. Add that to their stud qb and we have no chance in the secondary.
Really glad we have intelligent refs on the field  #MSUvsMICH
Mortifying to see the lovely French take such a brutal caning. #NZLFRA
It's a shame what's happening to the French #RWC2015
Lol wow how uncharacteristic of ESPN to pick a big ten matchup got game day over one featuring two top 10 tens from the SEC.
Well this has started off well  #BAMAvsTAMU
Loving this newly revamped Aggies defense. Impressive!  #notthewreckingcrew

Healthy "snack" right there on screen from the Rangers' game.
It’s not like OBJ is one of the best WRs in the game, go ahead and let him run free.
Teresa's priorities in prison.. Gia's makeup, fancy parties, and Joe's abs. Nice to hear she's changed, no?  #RHONJ

Broncos DB's hammering anybody who dares catches the ball near them. Defense carrying Peyton...as usual.
Rodgers stated he liked over-inflated footballs. Since 12/2012, no INT at home. PSI now monitored. 2 INTs today. #DeflateGate
Related... suuuuper glad I preordered from Amazon. Didn't even ship til 2 days after release.
Actually I blame Woodson for not returning those 2 INTS for touchdowns
Pats have really struggled since Hightower went out of the game
Good thing Cowboys settled for that FG on their last possession.
I so love when people tell me what's gonna happen in something I'm watching before it even happens #notreally  #stfu
Dallas, your tackling was brilliant!  #HowBoutThemCowboys #NFL #DFS
Cowboys probably rethinking kicking that field goal. But that's ok because we needed the points. #NEvsDAL  #dallascowboys

Wow that running play on 1st down was completely unexpected.
Correa is only 21??? Wow had no clue.
"Amazing catch by Larry Fitzgerald!" - Announcer Um, first time I've ever heard that.  #AZvsDET
Manning put to much on that pass for DT to handle.
Did Tom Brady get sacked or something? With this announcer I couldn't tell. #Patriots
it's a lot of fun pretending like I don't give a shit  #beyondbelief
At least we lost Jamaal during a win #ugh  #Chiefs
Wow refs, I'm glad you decided not to throw any flags today

thank you CBS for puttin on the Denver and Oakland game because I wanna watch the Raiders than the Patriots
Oh the #DetroitLions scored a touchdown. Yay! They're Super Bowl bound now. Haha.  Ok enough negativity about the Lions.

Yeah....growing up is also an option to loose creativity.  #justsaying
Spotify wasn't working so I was FORCED to buy Hamilton what a TRAGEDY to have the music at my disposal ALWAYS
I really don't think James Jones completed "the process". He caught a pass and did not secure it as he went to the ground.
Thank god the Browns have 3 FG's today we are still in it!
Joe Flacco running like Berry Sanders out there.. #CLEvsBAL
No worries. 5 more field goals and we are in the lead  #Browns
The best way to lose creativity is to find a job...which doesn't include your creative brain.

The #Browns can't win today w/o Dwyane Bowe in the lineup.
I love interrupted sleep and early awakenings.
Is Diamond a charm which lets two hearts stick together through this Lives?
Pitying Self with a tear in the corner of an eye,call for a film director to be cast in a potential role! #ActingkiMAA  #DramaQueen

Oh,sure. Forget like nothing ever happened. Like you never stabbed me with your words.
This night just keeps getting BETTER and BETTER....
Breaking (Legs): Chase Utley has the sniffles and is not likely to make the trip to New York for games 3 & 4.  #Mets #Dodgers
I hope there are even more body-shaming jokes made at Fat Amy's expense in the third movie. B/c those never get old.  #PitchPerfect2
Impressed with Smiths performance after that terrible injury....  ...
Dodgers cheating and playing dirty to win! No way?!
Sorry, forgot that I'm not supposed to be human and make mistakes or anything. #worstdaughteraward
Wait Dempsey was playing...????? where the hell was he lmaoooo
So the Michigan-Florida national championship is inevitable right?  #hopefullynot
A love going to bed after my teams lose. Just love it.
Twitter exists to repeatedly point out the church's flaws  But think about what you are posting on social media.
Yeah instead of watching it live on tv, i would prefer to press refresh button every 2 mins  #SticktoUCCricket
Addison Reed just gave up crucial runs late in a game? I am shocked....
That was sooooo out of character for Chase Utley.  #dodgersmets
Good to see the Dodgers still playing dirty. #dodgers #mlb # postseason
Goff is looking so Rodgers-esque tonight!  #DraftTwitterBeLike
Disgusting slide by Utley. At least attempt to touch the bag. Dodgers going to be the Dodgers. Class personified
Goff is the best player for Utah football.  #goutes
Goff totally the best player on the field... TOTALLY...  #CALvsUTAH
What a charming tradition to scream a derogatory term at the opposing team's GK every goal kick.  #bigotry #USAvMEX
It's amazing this game is 1-1, you know with all those "chances" we've had.  #USMNT #CONCACAFCup #USAvMEX
Klinsmann's emphasis on fitness really showing today.  #heavylegs
Is that a new song FSU band?  #MIAvsFSU
Tommy's always listening to me like a good boyfriend would

Possession IS over rated US. Nice job sharing the ball  #USAvMEX
Gee, I have such great, caring, and loving friends. Please don't stop. *crickets*
Baby u could be a bad motherfucker but it doesn't make u the boss bitch  #mood #bitch #af
Lol, also remember when if you wanted a list to be striped you needed to do it in javascript? That was the best.
I'm glad USA continually keeps giving Mexico the ball...Really...
Thank you TCU for taking a knee I appreciate it
I love the TVs in hotel rooms..
This whole let's not possess the ball thing for the US is really working out well.  #USAvMEX
They actually gave the USA a yellow? Shocking!
#Fantastic #weekend ( ) Sitting in my room doing absolutely noting! Why, you ask? I have no I idea.
If this Stacy Coley can get on the field, he could be good.
Even the Badgers haven't lost yet this season #firelucia
What was that? An athletic pitcher making plays...wow!  #baseball
Some people are so poor that all they have is money. -anonymous (  & #irony strikes hard when shaken not stirred together)
Of course #Turkey blocks its social media after the bombing. Everyone knows terrorists send bombs through Twitter  #TurkeyAttack
Man BA isn't any good at all......
I was such an emotional case at my niece's wedding this afternoon, I can hardly wait for next weekend.  #MotherOfTheGroom
Phryne may be his favorite model, but did the pizza delivery guy hit on her tonight? Didn't think so  #mfmmclub
Bozie & Lups best SO scorers both missed. #Progress . But it was good game #Leafs
Apparently we don't need a running game since our passing game is working out so well...  #MIZ #UFvsMIZZ
The new #NHL overtime format is a little dull for me... #MapleLeafs #TMLTalk  wow!!!
I'm sure Teena "selective memory" Mulder is exactly what you need to remember old events  #XFRewatchDemons
as was expected, Coker's ability to run played a huge role in that short field drive.
When the party you get dragged to has like two people your age :) #yay
Hope we come out and run the ball up the middle on 1st and 2nd again.  #WPS
Well Arkansas is wearing out. Didn't see that coming...
love that Chris & I get invited places
The big baddie for the last 2 episodes of #DrWho isn't terrifying at all

7 - 3 middle of the 3rd quarter. #SECNation #powerhouse
Oh how I love a day in bed with a migraine. Oh how wonderful it is.
Let's see what the exciting Bama offense is gonna do next!!!!
Michigan hasn't played anyone, so outscoring ranked opponents 71-0 matters not.
Guess that means tonight going to be great...
Vols fans everywhere: "Butch Jones is the best hire ever" Where was this enthusiasm the past few weeks?
I didn't know you could tackle a guy as he tries to get to the QB... Isn't that like a holding or something?! #Uhh  #Facepalm
Fatshaming is real! Durh! I get it all the time in front of the mirror!  #shahirant #bodypositive #struggleissurreal
Surprised they didn't find a way to credit Tori with Heather Locklear's casting, too. #UnauthorizedMelrose
Okay that's cool too. So glad I considered us really good friends.
Tonight I get to shoot zombies with paintballs and pee my pants from being scared. Yay haunted field of screams. ?
Politics is always a good topic to talk about over drinks
Yay!! Goal 2 Start planning the cup parade  #TMLtalk
Alexei Emelin with a low hit on the #Bruins Patrice Bergeron. Completely out of character for him.
#BTNLive nice replay. That was what we wanted to see
Remember the purpose of the church and gospel is American patriotism....
I wish Parise would work hard.
absolute fantastic reffing in this game right now  #Bruins
So this #Leafs game is super fun...
Philly losing 0-5 to Panthers, so we're good.
Fun fact: my fire alarms start to beep after the power has been out for 2 hours. #convenient
#Oilers it's almost like they have a coach that knows what he's doing. #DallasEakins
They've jumped offsides twice already...I'm sure wasting a timeout on D in the 1st can only improve things... #BYUvsECU
Pull Kinkaid! He sucks! Bench Tootoo! Fire Hynes!
Tennessee fans chanting "it's great to be a Tennessee Vol?" How original!  #IHateTennessee

First run by him all day. Wouldn't do that again
We are LOADED with talent at QB!  #Gamecocks
I can't wait to own a car that can bluescreen.
To be fair, Jamie has been injured for 90% of his career and probably doesn't know how to adequately field a bunt  #stlcards #mess
Good thing they didn't flag Green for targeting.
Wow, I just got bitched out by 13 year olds on Club Tortimer Island. Wonder why I didn't go there earlier?
WE deserved that win! Finally something goes OUR way! #bizonnation
TV announcers, "We don't believe in make up calls do we?"  #GBR #Huskers
What a beautiful day to not give a fuck about anyone...  #saturdayfunday #mood
Fournette may hurt himself running through holes like that, probably should sit out and declare for the NFL now....
Just a reminder. Cowboys are playing the Patriots tomorrow so yah…it should be a good day.  #CowboysNation
Phone issues are the best aren't they! Reminder to self ...don't ever drop it again!!!
When all Leidner has to do is hand the ball off he looks fine. #Gophers
Is this "make you respect us again" Saturday?? #causetheyallhavetohavenames
Whoever gave my name, number and address to the Mormon missionaries... #Thanks
Another missed call by #DarthRitter #inconceivable
Wow I'm shocked Harbaugh is a great coach & the niners suck without him & Michigan is instantly turned around
Maybe they should review that. I don't think he got in.
A blown call with #DarthRitter officiating. #NoWay
Interpretative dance & cat's chorus. Nice to see my lotto money is going to such worthy causes
So insurance covers boner meds but we're still fighting over birth control coverage and other reproductive rights. #seemsfair
Prominent male scientist has been harrasing women.I think what is now needed are some comments from Dawkins.

This just proves that the #Big12 is the best conference.. You just never know.  #SEC
Should Texas be in the top 10 now since they won? That's his the rankings go right?
If they had a ranking for 4-loss teams, Texas would definitely be #1
Dear #prednisone thanks for making my skin so thin and dry that it just randomly splits open.  #ouch :(
Wow I can't believe how smooth that drive went with JT at QB...

I love being the DD on a Saturday night for my parents. wouldn't wanna be doing anything else. .
All buckeye fans make sure you tweet at the players after the game and tell them they suck #BuckeyeNation
Why do friends insult each other sarcastically and rivals complement sarcastically? They're both belittling. And  is easily missed.
Homework on Saturday is so much fun....  #noitsnot
Thanks for ticking me off...you really are trying to make me have a good day.

Gotta watch the highlights on #fsmidwest...wait a minute, there are no highlights...  #stlcards
Let's watch the OC make some great calls here for #49ers offense.
I think James Jones is washed up.
Wow. I'm really, really bad about hiding my feelings and the like when I'm exhausted. This is going to go well, I can feel it.
James Jones was not a very good pick-up for the Packers...  #GoPackGo
Well this is 'kinda' exciting. #NASCAR #AAA400
And what's in the TPP? Oh ya, we aren't allowed to see it 'til AFTER it's passed. Sounds logical, fair, and emancipating!  #tyranny

I can already see the TUAlert if something like that were to happen. "Shooter on campus. Avoid the area. Non-Temple related".
It's reassuring when there's a problem with your flight & the gate agent is storming around frantically like a w/out a head.
How good is the wind in spring #HayfeverSucks
I'm not worried about a threat to Temple especially when you have a crack squad of savvy, motivated personnel like Temple security.
Tigers beat Pale Hose 6-0 to finish season 74-87. Should provide good momentum for next season! #likeabowlvictory

Freeze really putting in work today
Man. These NFL refs are really showing off how good they are today.
I love how the Packers make Kaepernick look like a Pro Bowler every time they play the 49ers
Shoutout to PSN for fucking up while I'm trying to buy a game
A sack from the right side of our O-line? So strange...
#musgrave called a helluva game  #conservative #raiders
This just in: Denver's defense is GOOD.
People being picked off in a science/military/space base by a monster, we haven't seen this 1,000 times before.  #DoctorWho
Ally McCoist will be the new Liverpool manager by the end of the week. #superally #bornforthejob #naturalprogression
Shocked the Refs didn’t flag the Niners for causing that false start.
Love woodys reaction to lols mum slappin her!  #ThisIsEngland90
Rodgers has a TD already that means his PFF rating is -100. Meanwhile Bridgewater is 8/10 and his PFF rating is +100.
Another gutsy win over a quality opponent by the Super Bowl-bound Colts...#borrowed time
That Aaron Rodgers TD pass should get a negative analytics grade. Far too much scrambling, play was too short.  #smh #NFL
So the #Jags lost to the NFL Over-40 team, #nice
Quality loss today. Way to go Jags!
Then Foles throws a td on his opening drive. Great Sunday.  #eagles
Three quarters of the field a lap down before the race is half over. So exciting. #NASCAR
I hope Hawkins chokes Donaldson after he just loafed it to first base and didn't play the game "the right way" on that groundout
#Jaguars win toss -- for once Gus doesn't defer.
What a great time to be a Philadelphia sports fan!!!!!!!!!!! #crickets  #Phillies #Eagles

I love finding out big family news on the Internet...
Good to see strength of team step up #Bills
Field goal makes tons of sense since you're down 14 and have shown a real propensity for shutting down Cincy's offense.  #chiefs
Weight loss tip of the day: when at a buffet, stop going back for 2nds and 3rds.. and 4ths.. #diet #weightloss #health

Terrible catch Odell, way to stay in bounds!  #NYGvsBUF
This airport has changed so much since the last time I was here.
Greg Gumble should check his privilege after making a shooting himself in the head motion on tv. #howdoes1checktheirprivilege
Prince Fielder just got on base via a hit. Wow!! it must be Sunday today.
I tried #Zen once....It only pissed me off. #humor #irony #funny
I'm sure Albert Pujols' career resurgence is completely natural.
What a thrilling offense the Raiders run.
Good thing the Houston Texans have spent so much draft picks and money on that defense. It's really paying off.
This is a Super Bowl offense, don't even bother saying otherwise. #Chiefs
Can't wait to run when I get home
I only msg u to check internet connection... Don't get excited 󾍇󾌫 󾌰󾌴  #you
See, I told you their kicker was going to make it. Now if only he could kick for both teams......  #EaglesTalk
When did Andy Dalton get so good? #Chiefs
The kicker finally makes a kick. Woo Hoo!  #EaglesTalk
Thanks to everyone telling me it was wrong. I actually hadn’t noticed!
Bradford drinking the Chip Kelly racism kool aid. Overthrows Matthews, hits Cooper. “Those coloreds should be faster.”
Witch hunts, inquisitions, crusades; we know how to party - your church #irony
Good thing I didn't bring my golashes.
Big 12 has 3 teams in top 10. TCU, Baylor, and OU. Impressive for the 4th best conference in power 5 conferences.
This has been a fun game so far  #BillsMafia
JJ Watt sure makes a difference in Houston.
Lots of MPs quitting because of bad Tweets & Facebook posts, but NOBODY quitting over niqab? How odd.
My fantasy team is absolutely killing it today
Worst part of tsa ??? When senior citizens that don’t understand technology pull you aside for being too technical YAY!
Oh no not Dwayne Harris please no shoot darn.....  #NYG #he'strash
Thank you Pandora for knowing just what songs to play to make me remember.  #ihateyou #memories
The good news is Rick Smith will get a high draft pick.
A Rex Ryan coached team that's ill-disciplined, committing lotsa penalties? How unusual.  #NYGvsBUF #NYG #BigBlue #Giants #NYGiants
Same about Rogers, one of Liverpool's greatest ever managers  #unitedfan #cheers
Yep #STLCards look good today!  Holliday def needs more ABs-They need to work on sharpness & BASERUNNING! Can't do that in playoffs!
#Bills are looking pretty good today. Tough to beat when they're playing like this! #NYGiants #NYGvsBUF #BuffaloBills
BS penalty on Rowe and now an unlucky bounce. Can't wait to see what the Eagles offense can do!
Jameis with another pick. But he's great fam!
Ashley Theo should be on every lightweights radar. Definitely the fight the fight fans want  #Boxing? #BronerKhabib
So glad #Eagles offense is getting to rest through most of the game. Again.
Eddie Pleasant with a big penalty. Never happens.  #TexansGameday
This Eagles sports science is really paying off
Bengals offense looks crazy talented...and that's without Jay Gruden. Hard to believe. I thought he was a visionary while there.
I love when Bradford "extends the play with his legs."  #FlyEaglesFly
OPI and now a delay of game. Good job there, #Giants.
Thanks for kicking us out of the library and into the ocean we call a campus. You rock Kimbel Library
Completely different #chiefs defense with Sean Smith back
Jerome Garces, what a fantastic referee
Glad to see the Eagles were well prepared  #Eagles
If only Alexis was world class
pretending to have someones best interest when you dont makes you rly fkn cooooool
Man alllll that money Texans giving JJ Watt (defensive player) sure has been doing them solid
First time around Camden earlier today for a leaving do. No Cumberbatch spottings unfortunately.
LVG is brilliant. Some days he brings back memories of SAF. Some other days, Moyes and ensures #nostalgia is eternal.
Looks like the defence took note of last week's game and showed up with energy and a smart gameplan.  #Chiefs
Oh boy, I'm so happy Dick Stockton is calling this #Eagles game!
Thank you, state of Tennessee, for not allowing me the CHOICE to drink an alcoholic beverage before noon on Sunday at a restaurant.
Feeling rejected is the best feeling in the world...
I was told a Holstein was primarily for its meat.... #learnsomethingeveryday
I just love watching men hump the air to celebrate doing their job  #NFL #collegeiswaybetter
Great play calling inside the 5 yard line  #firethemiamidolphins
Up early on a Sunday for no reason and to make my day so much better I got a stiff neck #havingagreatmorning  #ThanksBud
I love how people try to tell you how to get your life together,when they don't even have theirs together
Oh goodie, it's raining again in Hanahan. Cause we needed more rain. #chswx
I love cuddling and watching football alone, just such a great feeling
Oh, the horror! JP forgot the cold press! We're being forced to use the *gulp* percolator and chain market ground coffee. #survival
Depay off for Felliani? Yeah he's a game winner alright. And another winger at fullback, love it.
Oh Im PURRFECT at waiting. My patience is off the charts. Im so gonna have a blast this Oct. Im so lookng 4ward to it!Yay!  #BIGtime
#Luck out today against the #Jaguars. Great. Another exciting weekend in my football life.  #Colts
I don't have a short temper, I just have a quick reaction to bullshit
Never thought I would love Celibacy.
Oh no! We'll go 3rd if we lose!  #GGMU
I'm not watching NYJ-Mia, but those Tannehill stats, yikes. I still believe in the player. Maybe his new head coach helps. ?
We may need to rest Cech for the next game, the way he's worked his socks off this afternoon.  #Afc #AFCvMUFC #Arsenal #cech #coyg
It really breaks my heart the Dolphins are doing so poorly. ..Ndamukong Suh is such a great guy...
When in doubt...boot it forward to fellaini and hope he can Messi it into the goal
It's ironic, this is a game David ospina would be a great player in mr wenger #AFCvMUFC
Loving all the new muddy waterfront property in downtown Charleston.
Scherzer got a no-no last night? Didn't hear about that. Not like it was all over Twitter last night.
So you guys thinking Alabama jumps to #5 Ole Miss fall to #6 ND falls to #7 and Clemson comes in at #8?  #notreallythough
When I tell my dad the foods ready and he says "oh good I better eat, a skinny little guy like me will fade away"
Is Maradona at the #ARGvTGA game? Wish they'd show him.
So excited to work from open to close!!! :-)  #fuckingkillme
It's a QB clinic being put on in #London #nyj #miami

A year ago today I moved to bradford...time flies when you're living the dream I guess!

It has come to our attention that some of our followers and re-tweeters might not pass a Turing test. The beauty of APIs...
I think setting the alarm off at the orchard is my favorite thing, ever, of all time.  #earlyAMtvspot
tsss. very not stressing for only majors we're gonna have a final exam this week. #finals
Not only is today AWESOMe because your alarm failed to go off, but because you need an alarm on Sunday morning at all.
Up since 5:30am on my day off is even better.
I be like.. One of those... Who fight for rights with closed mouths.. And people shake already #Humour  #LetsBringIt

Why can't we do  for a living?
Need a caller tune which sounds like a busy tone.
Respect to singaporeans that can wear longsleeve shirts and tahan the weather.
Wow, there's such a thing as slutwalk for empowerment? Strutting the sidewalk in your slutty wear is empowerment? Just, wow!
wonder how the old timers killed time wen stuck in a chair without a fone in their hands..........Imagination??How Boring!
Let me tell you that I have the least #fomo ever and that's not .

I wonder if "The Handmaiden's Tale" has been translated into #emojis yet?
Heh heh. That was funny.  #MichikoAndHatchin
Haha. That makes you look really really classy!
I had a thought on the gun debate but the NRA paid me off.
Long ass day. And to find out I have to sleep on the couch is awesome.
Shannon made friends everywhere, huh?  #Unauthorized90210
#espn #CollegeGameDay #politicallycorrect #wrongbutton #nicecoverup thanks for dropping #Clemson coach  for saying #God #toopc
It's a good thing the #Mets aren't going to face anyone as good as Scherzer in the playoffs.
I really know how to spend my weekends.
people who fuckin smoke weed at some hippy chill spot on snapchat are the best.
I'm glad snap chat told me there was a IU Football game like 30x. I had no idea.
I'M SO GLAD NEMETH IS GOING TO PLAY FOR HUNGARY.
Yay another year of getting out shot 30 to 10 every game!
Awesome. So stoked that this is happening.
Bader beat Evans. Man I can't tell you how disappointed that makes me.  Evans is a punk. #UFC192
I love it when halfway thru a server reset the whole config file crashes and you lose your progress.
Oregons DBs are all goin pro I'd have to say
Notre Dame lost so now they are gonna be Ranked #1. LOL. .
15 minute hot shower to de thaw from 2 days of beautiful Ohio weather.  #divisionalshowdown
I'm getting sick so there's that to add to my great week that I've had
I probably would've ran the ball too!
Yall could be like me and work every Saturday of your life... You wouldn't have time to watch the football games.
Look at those classless fans rushing the field
Father of the year award goes to... My dad!
Another ND turnover. Couldn't happen to a nicer guy  #ihatebriankelly
Scherzer threw another no-hitter. Thanks Dombrowski/Avila!  #Tigers
I just love how females work
That recovered fumble on the punt return has to be Fresno State's longest play of the night.
Is it me or does Brian Kelly seem like the kind of guy you'd love to spend some time with? #Irish
my snapchat is so funny, it makes me lolz #totesrelatable #therealme
Yuniel Escobar's error keeps Scherzer from having a perfect game. He owes Scherzer a HUGE steak dinner and maybe a Ferrari.
The #Irish really made some good adjustments during the half on offense #NDvsCLEM
If a girl broke my 2k id break her neck.
Max Scherzer. Worst free agent signing ever.
I really like this Chiarot kid... Is he new?  #bogowho? #gojetsgo
I'm really proud of myself for waiting until the night before my photo shoot to decide what to wear...
If UK had beaten Fla two weeks ago, they would be in playoff talks tomorrow......
I want to make more sarcastic tweets that end with

What's the draft outlook on arkansas' TE? I haven't heard them say anything about it.
That's table abuse!!! I'm calling the authorities!
Mets fans are the definition of class  #Nationals
Injury update: Tokarski has shredded his confidence, might take 2-4 months to rehab. #PreSeasonMeansEverything  #mtlhockey
Glad to hear the puto chants are back in style. #CF97
Good job by the refs for blowing the whistle in a timely manner so Harris didn't continue to be mauled for no reason.  #LSU
We're tied with a team that lost to Toledo. Worried? Nah, I'm not worried.
What a glorious sunny Sunday. Perfect for spending inside doing my taxes
Don't you just love it when clubs repeat songs!!  #wearehull
Ok, so did one of the new rule changes become there is NO holding calls anymore?  #GoVols #BeatHogs
Good thing we have all 3 of our time outs going into half time.
Home field isn’t a big deal anyway..  #Mets
I appreciate my Rebels waiting until I'm off work at 9 to start playing tonight. #hottytoddy #olemiss
Wow, a 3 on 1 #GreatDefense #TMLTalk
A six divas tag team match?!?!? Holy shit sweet! #WWEMSG
One direction is splitting up....wow never saw that one coming
Ty iPhone for erasing every single one of my contacts :-) I appreciate it very much
Well that first drive was fun to watch.  #NDvsClemson
One good stat from today's #Husker game. 422 punting yards  Love my Huskers, but damn that was painful.
Given the story/ballad nature of Ian Anderson's songwriting isn't it time someone cashed-in and made a Jethro Tull musical?!  #prog
Also glad to see Ole Miss showing up to play UF tonight.
I see Pekka Rinne is already in mid-season form.
More brilliant SEC officiating in this game, I see.
Hey #Hog fans. Marc Curles is ref tonight. Nothing bad happens when he officiates.  #hehosedusandgotsuspended2009
The fact that the entire stadium cheered when they showed the Steelers released Josh Scobee shows you how much people liked him...
getting dogs to play with each other is pure genius! they usually are such sullen creatures who just want to keep to themselves.
But he's supposed to win the big games though right? #Huskers
Well, it looks like Rutgers is just going to have to be the one to take down Ohio State...sigh, always doing the dirty work
With all of these close games vs high ranked teams in big 10, must be a great conf.
I love being an adult and having drama in my life, it's like high school all over again
Good grief. So now Obama is ordering the bombing of hospitals?
So glad I turned on the Hogs game  #theyscoredin12seconds
Bored as hell so binge watching in YouTube #fun
Hurray... Now we can look forward to Alabama suddenly being top 5 material again tomorrow. #BAMAvsUGA #SECbias
That Ohio State defense has SEC speed for sure
Oh yay, we get to listen to the great commentators again next week...  #CantEvenGetNamesRight #LookingForwardToTN #GoDawgs
Swear I had to be damn near a computer programmer to download iOS and upgrade non-working apps on my iPad. #ThanksApple  smdh
What really hurt Texas today was the two missed field goals  #cutkrisboyd

I used to care about what people thought about me until I tried to pay my bills with their opinions  taken a notch higher. ;-)
Ugh, I have to go to a Toronto wide media/art festival. My life is so hard  #NuitBlanche
Pro tip: putting on a tie makes your shirtless selfie so much classier.
Ooooooh Bournemouth are good lol #motd #ncfc
"Break it to them gently" huh .. Cuz that was going to work .. .. ..
Typical Ohio state. Class all the way
Yay. Touchdown. Now we're only losing by 28 points. Woohoo.
Nick Chubb got is 100 yards. #UGA fans delight. Your RB got his yards!  #UGAvsBama
There's the Cason Beatty we've come to know and love!
Ever wonder how many tweets disappear into oblivion, unnoticed, sad and lonely? Poor little tweets.  #indiedev
I can't get enough of Christians who claim that non-violence or regulating guns is a "liberal" value.
ISN'T THAT A TOUCHDOWN REF?!?!?! SURELY THE WAY YOU MEASURE THEY GOT IN
Mike Leach is such a riveting interview.
Angelina Jolie's English accent is almost as believable as mine.  #TimeToChangeTheChannel. #NotAFan.
Will Bama jump into top 5 for this tho?.... Cuz ya know beating up on another SEC team is impressive right?
You know what REALLY helps when you're sick? Having no heat.  Michigan is rainy and cold af tonight. #WaitingForMaintenance
Well it looks like Ohio state's tough schedule is finally getting to them
Wait.. I thought Georgia was unstoppable.  #UGAvsBama
Thank you for informing me of your child's puking habits. I was really concerned about them.
I enjoy watching Ohio State kick field goals  #osuvsiu
This has been the best week ever...
Sam Burgess costing England the game again!  #scapegoat
My fiancé won a hotel stay from a vendor at a bridal show. Bout to sit through a presentation on fine china. #excited
Well that was unexpected. *rolls eyes* .
Oh that's weird, Stewart dropped a pass.
Just so everyone's aware this is all Burgess' fault...
Good job, #Bell! Only took you 21 hours to fix the Internet issue in our neighbourhood! #Greely

Dear Neighbor, Thanks for renting your house out to people who smoke weed. I never really did like fresh air.  #StupidestWALaw

Today is just a great fantastic day!!!!!
Can someone tell me what song they're singing not heard that before at EVERY GAME  #ENGvAUS
Well, #Texas, at least you have your own network, so you can analyze this one to death.  #LonghornNetwork #yikes #CFB
Yeah I'm so happy I had a midterm instead of going to the #PandaGame.  #CryingALittleBit
Oh good, another barely held win, great offense  #FireJohnDonovan
Decision of the day... Which beach to go too? Hmmm damn it's these intensely difficult problems that make life so hard

Odor takes out another second basemen? You don't say.

Chelsea are going to win the title for sure now
HOW DARE YOU SYNDEGAARD. Also, Mets fans are the height of class
Sorry to see Chelsea lose again
Shoutout to Medicaid for being down all morning until 1 hour before we closed. You the real MVP
I cant troll Chelsea anymore... Feel so freakin sad for them....
#OUvWVU Well that was a well used defensive time out
What my country really needs is another Clinton or Bush in the White House.
I flip over to the PSU game and Hackenberg has like 80 yards on two throws. Looks good to me, what's the fuss about him struggling?

Making more laws and regulations to attempt to stop people who already disobey the law just makes so much logical sense.
Temple and Memphis are 4-0. Think they'll make the college football payoff?

Water use fines during #CAdrought result in water rate discounts when it rains. Wait, it doesn't work both ways??
A new low standard for Russian "precision strikes"- leading a campaign against IS in Syria and missing Raqqa by almost 300 km!
It's okay. We did better without Graham anyway.
If the #Niners are really this bad, then the #AZCardinals should have blown them out... Guess AZ isn't really that good huh? lol
Another gold standard ref effort in this game. #NFL #49ers #cardinals
That's not roughing the passer? I'm shocked!
What is up with the Seahawks? Expected them to have a season like the Panthers. You think Ciara has something to do with this?
Nice last two drives by the offense to help out.
well he kissed ota motohiro and miyazaki 'goddamned' shuuto so i probably love him to bits rn.
Gotta love when the #49ers are looking this good against the #AZCardinals.
I want to grind COD, but my internet is just too nice and fast

That play...because Carson Palmer hasn't scored very many TD's as a QB this season  #AZvsSF
Had a fun breakdown last night thinking about my abuser  #whydoIdothistomyself

I am over joyed about going back to school!
Wish the Saints Bucs Bills and Dolphins woulda won but they all suck! Thanks for the help
Three points off a CL spot and through the group stages. Good thing we stuck with Allegri and never doubted him or the club.
We're so good at the 3rd period.  #LGRW
Wow, for once we won a game. When was the last time that happened?
Having a backward sleeping schedule is the best.  #insomnia

RT JustDeac Hey Bucks Monroe would have been open for 3!!! #DangIt  #Lottery
Run out the clock? Why aren't we throwing the ball? Is this really the chargers?  #illtaketheW
Brilliant last play by the Giants
The #Colts should clearly trade Andrew Luck for a seventh round pick or whatever they can get for him. Hasselbeck is the future.
So apparently Odell Beckham, Jr. is, like, a hall of famer already?
Good to see the officials are playing for the Colts today  #Bucs
That TD to Fowler justify the 4th round pick of him. If he's not there then who catches it. Lol
If i keep my Last seen ON, Then you will feel insulted every moment you check my presence on Whatsapp . LOL!!!  tweet

#PlannedParenthood if only those police officers who were shot had guns.
With a deep love of  #batman #harrypotter #thegrinch along with many many other awesome things....

Brutal night if you are a Pgh fan. First JA Happ signs elsewhere then the pens lose a meaningless regular season game to Columbus.
#PMQs - If you haven't got an argument, throw in some #ridicule & . #Osborne #EscapeRoute
Boy this bulls offense is so awesome. Good thing we got rid of thibbs.
Torts coaching another dirty team. Shocker.  #Pens

One of my coworkers takes a 15 minute smoke break every hour, so I've decided to start taking hourly 15 minute fresh-air breaks.
Tommy Armstrong make a poor throw? Never. He hasn't made a bad throw all year.  #hesucks #IOWAvsNEB #FireRiley

Waking up to the chorus of "I love Snape" is ALWAYS fucking delightful
Love going into halftime w/ all 3 timeouts.  With all of the flags thrown, 2 big missed calls on Nebraska scoring drives. #hawkeyes
More white on white crime. Why are white people such animals? What's wrong with them?!  (mostly)
Why isn't the pro-life movement taking responsibility for this? Why aren't they apologizing? Why can't they police themselves?
Apparently #Huskers' Armstrong is "at his best when he makes an accurate throw and good decisions." Other qb's just cant say that
I get to go to work with it icing outside. Yay
Welp, looks like someone shot up a #PlannedParenthood in my hometown today. Nice place we live in.

Evidently my company refers to it's corporate satellite feed as "Wall of Eyes" which totally isn't creepy as fuck.
It sure was fun having the roads all to myself this morning.
Am I gunna receive any more Black Friday emails today?  #BlackFriday
Since it's the busiest shopping day of the year, make sure you stop by a store just to pay a bill.
I love everybody. Some I love to be around. Some I love to avoid. And others I love to punch in the face.
Call it controversial but this year I have decided I'm not doing ribbon curls!!! #rebel

Wow. What analysis. An undefeated team is one of the best teams in the league. Who woulda thunk it?
Bday coming up on Christmas #yayyyy
Dang it Tony injured just before he mounts epic comeback.
Well, the Cowboys were soooo close to contending for a playoff spot. This Romo injury really sets them back.
And there ends one of the worst #Cowboys seasons in my memory. Super Bowl dreams blown up by the greatest OLine in history.
Today I'm thankful then Cowboys got rid of Weeden he was obviously holding them back.  #DALvsCAR
I sure am glad the Cowboys cut Corey White so they could play Patmon.
20-30% off from Canadian Retailers. GREAT DEALS!!!  #keepyourhalfassdeals

Nothing gets you more fired up for football than Luke Bryan
Phew. For a while there I thought veiwers were going to benefit from the TV rights negotiations. Hooray for status quo!  #nrl
Big Sean and Luke Bryan for music on the 2 games today. At least the music hasn't sucked.
The Obama war on Christianity is pretty brutal, according to what I see in my social media feeds  #ThanksObama

And the least impressive perfect team in NFL history keeps poundin'
Great. Fucking lost my voice. Exactly what i need.
Happy holidays! Political correctness goes both ways
I thought I was watching the reply!
All the Cowboys needed was Romo to come back. It was quarterback play all along that was causing their losses.  #notWeedensfault
Glad to see Romo is back.  #CARvsDAL
Good thing the Cowboys have Romo back or this game would be ugly
#Cowboys are better with Matt Cassel.

Eating my weight in raw oysters instead of turkey for Thanksgiving lunch. My life is so sad. I don't know how I'll ever survive it!
Wait Romo threw a pick six?!? No way he's not KNOWN for turnovers....
When u spend £40 on invites an end up havin to chase RSVPs.... Really good fun!
Chaos with airport workers in Brussels and the rest of Europe. Didn't see that coming.

Well #IStandWithAamirKhan because he is tolerant enough to give loose statements; people who are reacting are Intolerant

Twitter poll feature is really good ? #Recursion
Derek Carr is not the answer at quarterback for Oakland. He had a bad game Sunday, so they need to bench him.

Headset malfunction on Foxboro? Nah! That never happens!
That seems like a catch to me, but with the nfl that seems hardest to figure out.
I feel so broken, I treat my boyfriend with such love and care and he has the nerve to say I am mean...
I am just shocked Shocked! that the #Bills encountered headset problems while trying to tie the game in the 4th quarter.
Uncanny that communication towards the QB got fucked up in Gillette Stadium
Headset problems in Foxboro? No way. That never happens.
FOX removed Fantastic Four 2 from their release schedule. Biggest shock of 2015.
#WatchESPN is terrible tonight. It's ok, I didn't want to watch #MNF anyway.
is good for health. But one should know where to use it.
Fantastic Four 2 is now officially cancelled. Bummer.
Why would you ever throw ball to Watkins  #Bills
Here's an idea #Bills, bring in all of your big guys. The #Patriots will do the same. Then run the ball into the mess.
Are you kidding me?? 3rd and inches and you run outside? Another gem from Greg Roman #CaughtEmOffGuard
No rush guys. Only down two scores with 10 minutes to play. #bills

Just imagine how happy you'll be if you saw me and zoha l o l
Gonna be a fun day at work tomorrow
So Rex Ryan steps in front of a ref and helps to stop a patriots touchdown... But the patriots probably did something to cheat
The Patriots never gotten lucky before so if they lose they have all the right to complain about that play, which they will
I feel terrible for the poor, aggrieved fans of Pats Sox Nation. #cantcatchabreak
I have never seen a ref help up the QB until now, absolutely shocked it's Tom Brady
So pretty much the refs just robbed the Patriots of a TD... cool
Maybe.. if you keep complaining about the commercials.. networks will hear you, stop caring about $, and stop airing ads!
Ok Great. Now let's start trolling #Aamir Khan. How dare he felt unsafe in India. Uski itni himmat. Lets dig up some Pak links also.

Omg the West is so good in the NBA, seriously why does the East even exist?  #RTZ
Rodgers looked really excited after that touchdown. Must be something in his personal life.
Wife chew my ass earlier. Said I should be watching more, tweeting less. She's right. #1stTimeEver  ??? #GoHawks
Vikes just got another penalty. It's halftime. How's that possible ?
Man the refs really ran a great route and threw a laser.  #VikingsFans
So I guess Rodgers doesn't play with emotion
Good thing since I missed the sunset snapchat stories were there for me
That was interference, but if you were covering Jeff Janus, wouldn't YOU interfere too?  #GBvsMIN
'What time was your flight?' - the question on everyone's mind for Katie Healy to answer great job #RayDarcyShow
The #48 caught cheating?!?? What?!?!  #FordEcoBoost400 #NASCAR

Owen Hargreaves co-commentary on the MLS is about as good as his Man City career #thatmeansshit
#GeorgeBush & #TonyBlair conveniently disappeared off the face off the earth !!!!!
Hooray, a day of trying to explain to people why my aunt thinks I'm a boy. So much fun.
I love that my job is so wonderful about me calling out sick as I lay here under 4 blankets freezing  #ihatemyjob
Injured o-line is the excuse now for rodgers, yeah because Brady's o-line is brick wall right now
Can't wait for this week to drag again after the weekend going in a flash
I just fucking love being sick
Its really funny how someone so openly racist could be contesting the white house. Lucky America.
What was that WR the Chiefs had last year?? #82 ??
Everything is fine, Packers fans are spoiled.
I think you should all thank Rodgers for #LFC win yesterday. It was his team after all.
Thank god for all the pictures of the sky cuz i would have never seen it
wow, surprised to see that offense works way better with Rivers throwing the ball than without him throwing the ball...
Feeling alone even when I'm surrounded by people I like is honestly the best feeling ever.
Kanye's clothing line will make you look homeless AND BE homeless... GOD DAMN GENIUS
Wow what a close game for Cam and his 5 passing TDs
INCONCEIVABLE that they are finally going to start it. Wow.
Cassel had 3 INTs vs Giants, 97 total yds vs SEA & lost to the Bucs! THE BUCS! CLEARLY the better option over Weeden!  #NFL #Cowboys
Bed at 9:30. Can't wait for tomorrow
Is there any possible way to get more flags thrown in the NFL?
I can't wait for that 7 hour layover in Denver.
with the state of #philly sports I have to say I am Thankful for the theater #Eagles #Flyers #Sixers #Phillies  #curseofBillyPenn
Can't wait for Chip's post game presser about how the way to fix this #Dumpsterfire is to just execute better... #Eagles
Well at least we only have 4 days think about this loss!!! #LionsUpNext #HappyThanksgivingEverybody
Cam is on the sideline dancing and cutting up. Let me write an editorial to the Charlotte Observer. God forbid he have any fun.
Some people are too #stupid to waste my  on them!
So, how many Falcons fans are gonna blame Kyle Shanahan for this L?
Did you know Jeff Gordon was retiring after this race? I know crazy, right?  #NASCAR
5 touchdowns, 0 interceptions, and most thankfully 0 dances from Cam.  #NonStory #KeepPounding #SuperCam
Hey look, john Fox makes a bad play call at a critical moment in the game... Never saw that before.  #DENvsCHI
Look at the bright side #Dolphins fans, The safety streak is over.
One of the remaining five contestants will be our #XFactor winner. I'm relieved because for a moment I was confused
That field goal was just the spark we needed.  #WTF #beginningtohatefootballsundays
Wait.... is Jeff Gordon retiring? #kidding  #NASCAR
Anyone know if Olly Murs has a new single out?  #XFactor
Bryant took 4 steps in the end zone and then dropped the ball. Isn't that an incompletion?  #NFL
Winston has 5 TDs too....... #MVP
Aqib Talib involved in a scuffle??? No...no way...not him...  #DENvsCHI
To top it all off, Yahoo Fantasy didn’t even keep my lineup changes, Cam’s career day isn’t helping me any! Yay!
My tweets have been pretty much 50% indirects today. I really love life and how people love me. .
A pick thrown by Cutler. Who saw that coming? Everyone! Lol  #BroncosCountry
I'm glad the #Browns didn't draft Carr, he would probably suck.
At least it's NFL's top offensive team. This was to be expected. Tampa is known for putting up these numbers  #Eagles #EaglesNation
I really picked a great week to play against Cam Newton in fantasy
Wait for it wait for it someone's going to mention that it's recorded on Saturday #Shock  #Strictlycomedancing
You think we move down the power rankings a bit?
Calvin has 701 receptions... Lot of victories it's produced!
Isn't it a penalty for knocking the ball out like that?
Oh man I can't wait to go to the Dolphins jets game next week.
What about those old Japanese internment camps, can't we just send the #SyrianRefugees there?
Every salespersons favorite three words: "I'm just looking."
I was debating starting Patrick DiMarco in fantasy today. #DarnIt
Shout out to know-it-alls. Y'all make the whole world great.
Snitches are my favorite kind of people... Lol
Got to love it when the huge amount of money the various parts of government get is wasted on tech as opposed to the human element.
Wow.. Oh my goodness.. He actually threw it deep
This just in...the Eagles are good!
80 vehicles trying to get through passport control and only 2 lanes open. Well done the France!
Cowboys are the type of team to have a woman beater, a thug, and down right idiots on the team…definitely America's Team
Freeman and Forsett done in the first quarter. Awesome.  #FantasyFootball
Hey! That TD dance was offensive!
Helton subtext: You all were given your scripts, everyone keep to the script. And nobody wreck, Jeff.
This shootout in Detroit so much back and forth
Good to see the #Bears showed up to play today.

That Jack Kennedy isn't very good is he
Genetically altered food! Seems like a Great idea!
So happy that I worked all weekend
I've decided - next season instead of spending hours working on weather forecasts for #NASCAR I'll just tweet every weather app
Nope. Still can't go on Tumblr. I'm so happy the rest of the world has time to binge and gif 13 episodes of a TV show.
I love waking up early on the weekend and not being able to fall back asleep!  #guessIllbeproductive
VERY glad I took time to have a cup of coffee this morning.  #needtopee #oldladyproblems #ittybittybladder
More dropped points for the sheepies. No doubt sunbed Del will start having some questions asked about him now.
Already putting out best of list..a month left. Smh. How y'all know the hunger games part ii is not going to be best book of 2015
PT  (not about the humiliation part, but the public service part.)
So by the end of the year I should be able to go to my local church to watch Star Wars. Or maybe that's not how it works.
Ready to get this day done & over with. Holidays in retail are So fun.
Is there need to add the hashtag  to my previous tweets? Knowing this fandom someone could think I was being serious
I can't wait to see what birthday surprise you have in mind for me add maths. I look forward to it.
Breaking News #WonkyED coming back?wants to save the #Labour party .So it's #BringBackED Folks we miss him

People who curse/swear at their places of work are such high level professionals, that I find their company so reverential  #idiots
right when Sica does a q& a i cant post comments.. THANK YOU IG. THANK YOU REALLY  overflows
Time to kill myself with studying...yay
Unusual for #bbc to have an ultra right winger on to defend austerity #bbcsp
Ladies who flirt with serious guys by being patronizing, you are totally doing it right
Oh how times do change...  #TurnCoat
Yeah, I get why you pay for that 'expensive car' with a 9 year loan and then for RM12 parking. Style is really important!
Neat finish for Memphis. Bet Hazard couldn't do that.
You destroyed my life and I want it back and because of you I am having to fight battles on the daily alone so #thanks
I better remember names..esp. when sumone says "Hi, ur Chad right, the Elders Coord at WFN?" & in my head I'm like "Who are u?" lol
Im gonna get a cold.great.just great
All the heteronormativity displayed on the field today was greatness <----
~ no longer the lowest form of wit, now good for the brain. How what you think is bad, is actually good. Life, amazing.
You know those days where you work past midnight and then have to work 7 hours later? Yeah- I love those days
"That's a self-inflicted mistake." Good commentary, ESPN dude.
I love how my straight friends think it's perfectly fine to use homophobic slurs like f**, f*****, d***, c***** m******, etc.
Why yes neighbour, now would be a perfect time to play loud obnoxious music.  #stillmarking
Thank god for my house having crappy service
Canelo is a beast. Roach is 0 -2 in the two biggest fights of 2015. Roach is clearly trainer of the year for 2015.
#vertigo & #tachycardia attack. Called 911. In #ER #fun ...woot ( #bitter  )
It's so great when an audio book isn't split up into sections and the volume sucks so it takes forever for Goldwave to do anything.
Having nothing to do on a Saturday night is fantastic. I really love it. #teamNoSaturdayNightPlans #tooSchool4Cool
So they actually called a penalty in 3-3 OT and it was in Detroit's favor? #ImShocked
Well. I forgot how much I love winter driving, especially in the dark. Not stressful at all.
Oh it is always fun advertising #PainInTheButt
I wanna thank my sister for getting me sick

Can't wait to see the new standings this week.  #CFBPlayoff
Notre Dame looked really sharp tonight in Fenway
The way they've been handling the ball tonight I'm very confident they'll get it  #GoIrish
I love cleaning up dog puke at 10:30 at night.
Mississippi State and Arkansas. Wonderful defensive struggle.
Despite a loss - #Alabama #CrimsonTide prove they are worthy of #CFBPlayoff by toughing up their schedule w/ Charleston Southern
Clearly, defense is in abundance at the #MSUvsARK game.
I love people who think they deserve a round of applause for just doing what they're supposed to do.
How does anyone even score against these invincible SEC defenses ?
Let's hack and translate a game that is almost guaranteed to be in official translation. Won't hurt sales at all! Can't be abused!
It brings me joy knowing the fact that I pay Comcast $200 a month to watch reruns of Big Bang Theory and Modern Family.
Celebrating a victory over GA Southern. #UGA
Big win #Georgia lets get that new deal done with #MarkRicht  #GoDawgs
Another quality non-conference win for the SEC. Grit for the Dawgs to get past Georgia Southern
Stay classy Buckeyes ... Way to lose w dignity.  #GoBlue
Third man in the ring for the Rigondeaux vs Francisco is the very un-biased Kenny Bayless. #boxng

Alabama held to a 7-6 stalemate in 2nd half against Charleston Southern, that's gotta cost them in polls  #thatshowridiculousitis
Are the refs for OSU?! I just can't tell.
Ezekiel Elliott seems like a team player  #playforthenameonthefront He might have character issues #ego
I'm really impressed we are tying to establish the run game vs charlotte. Makes me feel like we are really good.
Yeah, I'm never going to get tired of "yassss". Never. Never ever.  #ForThoseThatCouldntTell
Can't tell you how much I love compiling stats for football all state meeting with no QuikStats. It's awesome.

Browns, Bengals and Buckeyes sure have done Ohio football proud these past seven days.
"It's really weird getting used to being respected by men." "Yeah, what is that about?"  #feminism #respect #lol #standards
Great play calling all game Ohio State..
(somewhat) Thank you #OSUBuckeyes for saving me thousands of dollars. No need to scalp #CFBPlayoff tix and hotels this year
That was a terrific game plan by Urban Meyer.....
Good thing Michigan State won't be motivated to beat Penn State by 30.
Another fine officiated game in the Big 10 in Madison, so glad officiating never decides a game!
First ranked opponent. Loss. Big surprise from the buckeyes.  #strengthofschedule
I love having to work harder because you're crap
Hate that we r gonna lose against ole piss but hey we r a basketball school anyway #LSU  #beardedlife
put Braxton in at qb since no one else can pass #OSUBuckeyes
Nothing puts me in the Xmas spirit, like troubleshooting non-working tree lights.
I did really well at being productive today
Yay!! 5 MORE FIELD GOALS AND WE GOT THIS!!
Complete confidence this offense can drive the ball 98 yards to take the lead.
Kylie and Tyga are back together. The world is back in order.
Classy! VU Athletics sends Spirit of Gold Band SR members off with a toast...using sparkling grape juice from Dollar Tree.
All those QB up the middle plays was to set up the TD pass.  #OSUvsMSU
Wow. #Buckeyes play calling is the most innovative I've ever seen.
I haven't been outside yet, is it snowing? #thankyoueveryone
If Ohio State beats Mich St, I assume they will be number 1 since they played in the rain based on the committee's criteria
Man them SEC teams looked great today against them FBS teams today
NYCHA is really doing a fine job of denying black people for apartments..... ...
Charone Peake dropping a completely catchable ball? No way. #Shocking
The SEC is unstoppable! Like being in the NFL!  #TheCitadel #FloridaAtlantic
Running game working so why not pass the ball. #USC
South Carolina and Florida done the SEC proud today....
I've always heard UNI was a basketball powerhouse
Cheers to all who pointed out some acts are pre-records. Shame I now have to waste 8 characters after most tweets typing ' ' #xfactor
Alabama in a real battle with Charleston Southern. 26-0 end of 1st. #SECdominance
Wow do I love the refs  #theyshomers
Really sad to see North Carolina lose!
Wow what a great PAT by the #1 team in America right now.
ESPN don't worry about anything that is happening on the field!
Lots of girls gyrating in not much clothing on the #XFactor Qudos for sending the right message to young girls
No call against Ohio State......SHOCKING....  #B1G
Mark Mangino has no class whatsoever, trolling the Iowa State football team that your son coaches on. Real stand up guy!
So plans tonight got cancelled yay
Driving in snow is the best. Who would ever want a sunny day and warm weather. Lolz!
In light of ESPN's criticism of Big 12 non-conf schedule I am glad Alabama has such a tough opponent today.  #CFBPlayoff #bama
Connor Cook is really just being a wimp. This is why he's not a captain. #Narrative
I love my Spanish partner and I'm so glad she translated 3 sentences! She even gave me $0 to help pay for it! She's the best!
Wow Florida beating that powerhouse Florida Atlantic team in overtime, that should move them up in playoff poll.  #SECBIAS #eyetest
When you feel like you don't belong, that's a great feeling.
Since when did #TheHungerGames turn into #residentevil? #movies #videogames #Scifi #horror  #MockingjayPart2
SInce #Gators make big plays in tight moments, it's easy to see how UF could knock off FSU and Bama and get into CFP.
The #SEC tho you guys. Soooo good.
How on earth did the refs allow Michigan to score?  #UMvsPSU #GoBlue
This is why you go for the TD at the 1 yard line. Another epic coaching job today

What? #IowaState is getting outplayed/out coached in the 2nd half? Didn't see that coming.  #CyclONEnation
Iowa's on track for another résumé enhancing win against 2-8 Purdue. They should be ranked 2 or 3 after this week for sure.
Well that was a great sequence of plays #MICHvsPSU
Florida looks great today. Every program should be scared
South Carolina and Florida struggling vs FCS opponents!!! Yeah the SEC is supper deep!!!  #SECBias

Max Talbot is very comparable to Frank Vatrano so the call up makes sense. Takes lots of shots, has offensive upside. .
Only 48 more hours until my work week is over!

I think I'm going to stop covering this team. I don't know what's happening anymore. Jeff Heath making two INTs to save the season?
Wow our line is just so amazing!
Cam Erving looks like a stud to me.
powerful display of offense going on in Tampa Bay right now. #donotmissit #BucsvsCowboys  #Romocannotgetbackfastenough #nextweek

Sam Bradford got hurt. Didn't see that coming  #Eagles
Kids today have it so bad. So what if you got drafted into the military the real problem is my phone charger isn't long enough.
That #Cleveland o-line must be the greatest ever to NOT hold that entire time.  #CLEvsPIT #refssuck
Finally checking in on the #Eagles game. Just in time to see Bradford get injured. Cool. Today is turning out to be super awesome.
Keep hanging the ball off that seems to have been working all game  #Titans
Sooo... I guess it's safe to assume Rhonda lost?  #TimelineFlooded
They converted on 3rd & 16? I'm shocked.
That beautifully thrown ball that Tannehill just threw that was dropped by Stills, is Tannehill's fault.
Well, clearly Aaron Rodgers is finished and needs to retire. #BenchRodgers  #PFM #Broncos #BroncosCountry
Nice strong play by Fasano on a crucial 3rd down  #Titans
Taking important, must-have plays out of Drew's hands is ALWAYS a good call. #saints

I saw a man outside getting attacked & chased by a bear. Instead of helping him I locked my door and windows & sent prayers

Sarcastic remarks on life will return as soon as I'm done being a sour yuzu  #comedy

Sick, tired, hungry, sleepy.... Great day!
Ogah's pressure probably prevented a deep TD pass. But, no, he's not one of the nation's best defensive players.
just sent in my app to Southwestern college uff I hope they accept me
I think UMich fans should be ashamed of all the empty seats at #MICHvsIND game.
In an 8-team playoff, OK State would be in with wins over Baylor and OU regardless of what happens today. Can't wait for that day.
I mean, yeah, I definitely thought the "black kids" totally ran the school and kept the "white kids from learnin'."

And....UNC just scored too. Great. This academic scandal has obviously taken its toll.
Kudos to the person yelling "what was that, dumbass?" at a high school game. You're winning at adulthood.
I, too, blame modern technology for terrorism. Like crypto, they could've never made it as far w/o electric light. BAN ALL LIGHT!

We lost #cortaca, can you see my surprised face? #oops
I'm sure that IS is reading your #peaceinparis hashtags and reconsidering their whole agenda.
I guess it's better to let 4 million people be slaughtered in a war zone than allow one bad person into your country. Smh.
You might have to go to church or talk to a believer instead of Starbucks to hear the Gospel. Imagine that!
Texans Rule Out DE Jadeveon Clowney (Back) and CB Kareem Jackson (Ankle) vs. Bengals, I'm shocked

Sure am glad Cardale got replaced...
Good punt. InB4 "even Niswander would kick further than that."
This Michigan State team definitely looks like a "playoff" team, and a team that totally "dominated" a better Michigan team.
I bet Isis is looking at all the social media outrage amd hashtags like #prayforparis and regretting what they've done.
I see that our offense is looking just spectacular today

Been compared to a shitty ex makes me feel proper fantastic

Who cares what happend in Paris, last I checked the French were white. #Mizzou #ParisAttacks
Must be nice to be perfect in order to be in a position to criticise and judge others.
I wonder why terrorists carry their identities while carrying out a suicide attack?
#BalNarendra if u dne with ur fantasies of wrld tour ,fancy dress n gifts exchange with who's who cn we get PM of india back ?
That’s the spirit Negative Georgia Fan! Flex those whiny muscles on social media for all the world to see!

If there are a few rotten apples. you should cut down the whole tree. because no one likes the good apples.  I hate people.
Why are no laws against explosives and Kalashnikovs in Paris!? Maybe they need to establish more #gunfreezones? #Parisattacks
my friend does the same but I let it slide cause I come from a family of officers #noseintheair #almamater
Nothing more awesome than being wide awake at 4:25 am on a Sunday morning. #woohoo
Brandon's snapchat stories from last night are so easy to read..
I have a question, How come #ISIS never attacks #Israel?  #ParisAttacks #PrayForPeace
Remember, it's only a small percentage of Muslims who ate violent.

Wilfred Zaha and Jason Puncheon seem like a barrel of laughs don't they.  #soccerAM
I think the Paris attackers are basically peace loving citizens. They have just selected a wrong path #ParisAttacks
Saturday, 6 pm. and I am still stuck in the lab. -.- #happyweekend
" #Hollande should invite opponents to #Minsk. Peace is more important than revenge": more #Ukraine tweeps wake up to pour  on #Paris

Good job on open borders #EU, #Merkel, #Hollande. Let more people in indiscriminately, keep meddling in Middle East.  #Parisattacks
The president of Iran has condemned the Paris attacks. Yep, those Muslims are all working together....
I love leaving work after midnight and then going in at 8 am the next morning  #fuckmylife
how did I gain followers? easy. twitter was built for the sarcastic dark-witted comments from a genuine geek #salty #nerd  #witty
The terrorists were not Muslims. They were shouting, "God save the Queen" not "Allahuakbar" during the attack.
getting the teen up for work on a Saturday is always a joy
It's kind of reassuring when I see my friends in the Philippines marking themselves as 'safe from Paris attack.'
I'm sure ISIS was just terrified over Obama's speech tonight Probably thought he was going to issue another red line SCARY  #Paris
I'm sure ISIS was absolutely terrified over Obamas speech tonight Probably thought he was going to issue another red line  #Paris
But just remember guys, Islam is peaceful religion. Make sure all the families with dead members know that.

burst pipe, flooded kitchen, & stinky water: #tgif
I have such good fucking friends
I swear to god, we harbor some of the most fucking ignorant & close-minded people ever. #GodBlessAmerica #ignoranceisbliss
#ParisAttacks Paris news media: Now lets not get to hasty w/ our condemnation. #unbelievable Second only to liberal US media.
I love it when pastors use tragedy as a time to fuel the flames of hate. Because that's *exactly* what Jesus would do.
When you comment on someone's tweet & they clearly didn't like your comment because they unfollow you. #mature

Denver should never run again #analysis  #maybe #DENvsIND
Also, by definition, can we expect to see Jimmie sit out two weeks for altering the chase?  #NASCAR
receivers gotta adjust to a less than 100mph pass
Mike Evans, ladies and gentlemen. Wide receiving phenom indeed
Great offensive play calling down the stretch Byron Scott, love it
My wife and I were happy for twenty years; then we met.
Peyton Manning killing it for me again in fantasy. #DENvsIND
I told you guys that Colin Kaepernick was the problem. With Blaine Gabbert running the show, the 49ers have a top-five offense.
Remember early this year when Drew Brees was nearing the end. Clearly his demise is imminent.
Luck was touched! Where's the flag on the Broncos?????
Gabbert to celek the new Brady to gronk!!!!!! #49ers
On the bright side we held Heath Miller in check  #Raiders
Not sure which I'z most excited bout, the #JohnLewisXmasAd or the #cocacolatruck. Jus wonderin if I've climaxed too early
Phil Simms needs to talk more. #NFL #CBSSports
I'm sure NBC crew is just thrilled Hardy is playing tonight. Can't wait to have to talk about him and the issue all night.
Sigh. #SacKings lose, #SJSharks lose, and #Raiders lose. Awesome sport weekend...  #thatssportsforya
Hunting for Audino to level up in Black 2. Much fun.

#FireCapers amirite amirite?? That OL breakdown... all him!!
Please, let's make Blaine freaking Gabbert look like a legitimate starter. That's all I want. #ATLvsSF
Aaron Rodgers sure looks like he'd be a great teammate.  #totaldouche #fuckthepackers
This has me wondering why the 6 team put the left side tires on the right side?
love it when you're at the stop sign and the other person looks at their phone, then cuts you off.  #hitme #foolishness
People are bashing Starbucks for not having Christmasy cups? God knows that's a truly urgent issue in the world...  #priorities
Just saw one of those #PCDoes ads. I'm running out right now to get a new #Windows10 PC right now!!
Probably should have added  to that last tweet *shrugs*
I just LOVE living in PA and not being able to watch the Giants game
another day...another account I noticed Twitter unfollowed for me..thanks Twitter.
And Sean Miley Moore gets sent home.. Didn't see that coming  #xfactor #rigged
Man, BJ Raji is tearing that team apart. Can't believe he got mad on the sideline.
Didn't expect that...you couldn't tell or anything...
I'm glad tire issues are going to decide this championship. #NASCAR
It's totally my favorite thing to be talked down to by strangers at the airport.
I love that a player can lose possession when they take a helmet to helmet shot in the NFL.
So glad I started Martavis Bryant this week #FantasyFootball
That's ok. I just mopped the floor, walk across it with your dirty shoes. I'm down with that. No not really.
Man, and I was so looking forward to a Peppermint Mocha soon at Sbux. What a disappointment.
I do love a good stress headache followed by blacking out for a bit. Especially when I'm home alone. That's my favorite.
Joe Buck "Capers defensive philosophy is to not allow the other teams to score" YA DONT SAY. What a cutting edge approach  #GBvsCAR
Guys wide open over the middle. Never see that during a Steelers game.  #PITvsOAK
Wesly Woodard is still in the league?!  #TENvsNO
You're right everyone, Teddy is terrible.
Greg Roman is the goat offensive coordinator
#Browns are the only team in #NFL history to lose during the bye week.
3down 5to go gotta love nursing  #nursing #nurseshifts
Nice of the refs to save the Steelers when they don't have any time outs left.  #OAKvsPIT
Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy. #logano
I didn't so many people from Wisconsin lived in Charlotte.
Logano crashes! Suspend Matt Kenseth #NASCAR
So glad the packers showed up today.
And yes, I intentionally said PERIODS. NCAA has I instructed not to use the word QUARTERS. NCAA hard at work
And we're single file by lap 3 YAY
Think the #Patriots could trade CB Rashad Melvin for a Redskins OT mid-game? Just return them after the game? Mutually beneficial.
Spilling coffee on myself has drastically improved my mood.
Cut Peterson. He sucks. We don't need him.
Oh. Saint Shula's back. Let joy be unconfined.  #thearchers
Thank to #CoachUSA for using a crazy route through Union City and causing us to miss at least HALF a game! Argh! #NYJ #NYJets

Nothing makes a niners fan happier than to see Michael Crabtree be a good, not just competent WR, in Oakland.
Finally #acchedin in Bihar will remain for 5 more years..!!yippiee When will entire #India witness it?  #biharelections
#Hypocrites are awesome... let them help you polish your ...
Joe Allen would've made a difference today.
That riggle skit was comedy and we got called racist! Love it man! We hate Indians that's why we are called redskins!!
Yes, FOX, an undefeated team winning over a one-loss team is definitely an upset.
I insist on a starbucks cup with a hole in the side for Martin Luther King day  #WarOnChristmas #StarbucksRedCup
Surprise! Eastbound rte 87 is running late! Did not see that coming.  #OCTranspo
When the fire alarm goes off that means it's the perfect time to meet the neighbours #lovinglife
So, some people are super pissed over Starbucks' red holiday cups and they're boycotting? Yeah, I'm sure this will impact sales.
Of course, our asylum seeker policy is all about protecting people and saving lives, you know.
I LOOOVE when people snapchat the entire concert they went to cause that means i dont have to spend money to go see it.
Yeah so picking Bony over Harry Kane has worked out well.  #fantasyfootball #shite #shutitMrA
Im so glad #starbucks didnt offend me with their holiday cups before I got my #PSL fix this year!  (both with the cups and the PSL)
Fake friends are the best friends.  #idgaf
Well, we have frost in Iowa. And it’s only November 8.  #iawx

Feeling single when you're in a relationship is such a nice feeling

GAZZA!!!!! Geez Smithy looked happy didn't he?  #AUSvNZ
So great to see Lane Kiffin win, he deserves it. #ALAvsLSU
Stage makeup does wonders to the skin.
You + Me = May be
So much so for being responsible to the environment, bursting crackers in the name of victory. How sweet!
I never get tired of every WR complaining they were interfered with and every CB complaining they never touched anyone.
Shocking Jake Butt got someone to be his fall guy on the tweet. Never saw that coming
I feel completely at ease with cardale finishing this off.
I feel like refs make bad play calls partly so they can hurry the game along and go home cause their job is extremely hard...
Seems like Bihar wants a #Intolerant govt.
That moment when irrational brain goes screaming off and rational brain can't catch up to give reality. I love panic attacks.
always nice learning new things about yourself
C'mon guys, #GregHardy expressed regret over Twitter! What more do you want?!  #pathetic #Embarrassing
Best win of the season? I think it is likely.  #Huskers #BeatMSU #NEBvsMSU
Oh it's going to be a fun couple of days on Twitter with what I'm expecting to be some very clean and respectful UM-MSU banter.

Absolutely loathe that melancholy horror Adele's new single. Fuck sake hen, get a grip of yourself and move on.  #maybe
Some exciting #SEC football in Tuscaloosa.
Funny how smartphones make some people structural science expert.
Thanks Verne. That was very enlightening.
Ohio state should run the read option more, no defense knows that's what they're gonna run...
Nothing I'd rather do on my Saturday night off then go to a wedding reception.
U have a 6'3 240 lb RB and don't give it to him on 4th &1... Lane ur a genius
Good thing we came here tonight so we can just sit here and watch college football. #yay
Waited 4 hours for my video to upload.. to only find out I clicked the wrong file and uploaded my old vid again. #imnotangry
How to get away with murder, when I really should be sleeping. Wonder why I'm not a morning person?
Can't wait to hear Verne call Derrick Fournette or Leonard Henry tonight.  #retire
How deep is the SEC with the Razorbacks beating an Ole Miss team that beat Alabama on the road!  #overrated
Looking forward to Vern's insights during the Alabama LSU game.
Let's just make fun of people with mental disorders
Also it's very clear that what Hardy did was def as bad as Brady maybe possibly knowing one ball may have been slightly deflated
Well, didn't see that one coming  #ARKvsMISS
#ExtraLife Hour 06: Braid is so mind-melting, I missed an update. Think I'll switch to something easier on the brain... like Fez.
Cleaning the house is so much fun.
Lol Clemson is rushing the field as the number one team in the nation??? They really belong
I love how people dominate the conversation because they love the sound of their own voice.
Why would you throw it??  #GoCougs
Gosh dang Brandon Allen short arming a pass again. Shocking!
I'm not sure if everyone knows Beathard has a groin injury. I mean they are hardly mentioning it.  #Hawkeyes
This is the best O-Line in the world...not one holding call.  these refs..smh #FSUvsCLEM

We need better commercials and more of them!
Good thing #Broncos get the ball to start 2nd half -- when they always play their best.
Some guy in a car told me I was beautiful then took it back when I didn't answer my feelings are hurt  #ok

I was expecting a 7 goal thriller #manvche
#ooc No charges again for a cop who shot an unarmed child. How stunning.
Manchester United and Chelsea just played a nil-nil draw and the world is just flabbergasted!
8 games without a win, Man U are really fun to watch this year  #weneedawin
And it's always tragically comical reading what laws enabled cops to get away with murder. Way to add insult to injury...good job
Loftus-Cheek coming on for 30 seconds. Guus giving youth a chance.
It's fine, it's not like I was going to eat my left overs from last night anyway....
Nice, the guy that shot a 12 year old won't face charges #tamirrice #seemsfair
What a great way to start the day!
I'm really glad I went to work today

At least he called and apologized. But the household is obviously more important than a close friend. Gotta accept that
Just been called a 'fat ugly cunt' by some radge that cut the line in Scotmid. I'm evidently beside myself with joy.
I'm amazed that CBJ are not playing their best hockey, what with the stella support their coach is giving  #confidencecrusher
Your excitement is too much for me to handle. Chill.
I'm still upset that I couldn't vote in a referendum on giving housewives, coloured-people, and Indians the right to vote. #cdnpoli

hmm... Cesc wants to leave Chelsea, how surprising...
Great example to the young kids from NFL on FOX extensively showing Rams players mocking and cussing at the fans.
The fun part about visiting home is seeing everyone that still lives here.
Thanks for a wonderful performance two weeks in a row Mr. Rodgers!  #wheredmymoneygo
Well, there goes 3 hrs of my life I'll never get back. Thanks, #Packers.
Plagiarism...so awesome being a victim of it.
My night couldn't possibly get any better.
I LOVE being short bc I see everything so clearly! #xtremewinter
Lady Violet is waiting for cousin Isobel to arrive, they have dinner and chatter planned! There's something new.  #Downton
And the offensive play calling from the Green Bay sideline is still spectacular
This team has no identity, but hey, they're in the Playoffs! #Packers #GoPackGo
I'm surprised Benn was well enough to get the assist on the goal  #STLBlues #Stars
so glad #eagles replaced #andyreid with #chipkelly #eaglesnation #chipmustgo  don't let the door hit you in the ass
THIS MAKES SENSE TO KEEP RODGERS IN #PACKERS
So did one of those backup tackles let that happen with no help. I mean how does that happen.
My favorite thing in the world is listening to you self-inflicted problems.
Got a gift card for the regal...good thing I got all these gf's to go with
I love one dimensional female characters in comedies.
Good job for prioritizing the activities inside the floor rather than work and be productive! Keep it up!
Wow I feel so loved I can't contain it all lol
That Sturridge lacks character he does. Doesn't have the mindset he doesn't. Won't play through pain he won't.  #LFC
Yay, a forecast of sleet and freezing rain with heavy winds tomorrow. Which could lead to power outages. I can hardly wait.
When your family ditches you for Christmas and when you finally see them they don't even acknowledge it #notevenasorry #bestfamily
Good start to the second half #Packers  #gameover
The Packers are really putting up a good fight today
I love the feeling of turning the corner to see a non working escalator. #WhatsThePoint #EveryCTAStation
That missed extra point is the shot in the arm we needed. We got all the momentum now.
Thanks a lot Masthay you just allowed our QB to get sacked 2 more times because of that boneheaded fake punt.  Our #OL sucks!!

It's nice to see the packer offense is keeping drives alive...
Back in the land of never ending cornfields and dismal grayness. I'm overjoyed, obviously.
Chris Myers and Ronde Barber. Rams & Seahawks. The gifts keep on coming.
So glad Brady took a knee with 20 seconds left.  #NEvsNYJ
Oh my, if the patriots were to lose, my Sunday would be ruined.
You hate Cam Newton for totally legit reasons and your revelry in his not reaching NFL glory is perfectly rational.
That Ron Rivera is a crap coach. Panthers should have hired Mike McCoy, obviously. #Chargers
sad but true! that's life, the only positive result of knowing that -- 1st you know the truth behind that "loyalty"
This is a classic fun jets game
Who could possibly have it better than us?  #49ers
Now I just need to drive a jacked up ford with a rebel flag in the back #pt
I love the rain especially when the power goes out. Houston is the best y'all
Least he didn't take a knee. And you people want to trade for cousins....
That's a non call. Good job refs
O-line in the whole draft  #49ers
INSTANT ANALYSIS: great use of a timeout #Tomlin. You are coaching so well ( ), Harbaugh might actually beat you. #Steelers
Julio Jone caught the ball over a tripping safety and a much shorter linebacker. #Congrats
Really looking forward to the game vs Chelsea tomorrow...... Not!  #lvg #boringfootball
They demonize Bill 4 sexually assaulting women but don't care that Rush called a woman BITCH who wanted taxpayer funded abortion!
Gee ..... against this Baltimore secondary, area you sure the #Steelers shouldn't go back to a more run-oriented offense today?
Love to find pics of me! (not my pic) #lmao #wtf  #itiswhatitis #bitchcraft #bitchyhumor #fuckery #cray #forrealtho #icecream #…
Some agencies still hang their hat on delivering impressions. As the saying goes, "Quantity over quality," right?
Beautiful strategy: #Bills anticipate the INT and so they killed the clock at end of that drive.  #DALvsBUF
Yay unexpectedly working on your day off! :D
You know what I love the most? House hunting.

Soooo.. ... How about 2015 ending so beautifully, am I right?!  #layingitonprettythick #bringon2016
Ugh. Drop the ball. #MentalMistakes  #DontYellAtMe
Seriously Eagles? What a stinker. Can't wait to see what "GM" Kelly has planned for the offseason...  #PHLvsWAS #EaglesNation
I'm going to be in Tempe with my family on New Years Eve. Oh what a joy.
1 yard in the 3rd quarter for UCLA? Wow great Defense for Neb!  #clockmanagement
On the bright side, the #OdellBeckham suspension no longer matters.
Sixers win! Sixers win! Go crazy folks! #Sixerswin #SixersTalk
Another hour and a half and I get to sleep for a bit and then go and do it again later. Yay!
I have literally left my bed twice today, to get medicine and to get food. Being sick is fabulous.
Hey #Huskers quit playing so rough.
The #Eagles two big offseason acquisitions just connected for a Fucillo HUGE play right there. .
There goes DeMarco Murray proving us all wrong.
So who's ready for tomorrow's pre season type game between #CowboysNation and the Bills? #cantwait  #NFLSUCKS
Having a hard time finding a job in the field? #shocker  #HAH
That Eagles trade with the Bills McCoy for Alonso is really working for the Eagles.  #terribletrade.
That McCoy for Alonso trade was just brilliant.  #WASvsPHI
So even though he's down by contact he has to maintain possession even if a DB rolled him over 58 times. Smart.  #NFL #DumbCatchRule
UCLA is a little chirpy. Darn California teams.  #californiakid
Logical, he just kneeled instead of spiking #WASvsPHI
It's ok...I never believed face masks were a real penalty.  #Huskers
Obviously the Redskins game won't end up coming down to a not-attempted field goal.  #idontlikethat
Early nominee for next season's fantasy football team name: "Chip Kelly's System"  #BullshitArtist #NFL
Great clock management by the Redskins #WASvsPHI  #funnyendingtothehalf
Smart move Walter Thurmond. Smack the ball away...give a free first down and a chance for the Skins. #Saavy

Christmas cheer tonight has been too immense. .
And yes #Buffalo , these Sabres are terrible. You're definitely right this season to not go to their games. Uh huh.
I've read about how great the design focus is at AirBnB... then I used their mobile site... #nailedit #ux
Wait was that Emelin who got beat wide? That never happens.  #Habs
Man, when Chip Kelly's offense gets rolling it is impressive.
Crosby's back! Best player in the world again!  His next goal will be in another 8 games. #useless
Great job by Billy Davis adjusting after Reed went right down the field on them last series.  #PHIvsWAS
No Jordan Reed isn't Pro Bowl worthy... Not even close

It's like 70 degrees in NYC, but #globalwarming isn't a thing.
The secret to making people feel seen/ understood is to ignore what they say in order to get your much more important point across.

So sad to see Lindsey Graham drop out of the presidential race. I thought for sure he had the nomination wrapped up.
Someone leaked "The Revenant" and "The Hateful 8" screeners online. Because those films are best viewed on your smartphone screen.

Thanks for leaving me in the dust man!
Bring back Donald Trump to the Miss Universe Organization! Hahaha....
Giving cars as Christmas gifts. So realistic. I think I'll run out and grab a new Benz for the little lady. Hope it fits.
People question Rey's expert use of a lightsaber in #ForceAwakens. It's not like she's seen carrying a weapon in any other scenes

Keeping up with the Kardashians and girl problems. Great Sunday
Pretty disappointing first half for Baldwin, only 18yds. #Seahawks
Yeah, why bother covering Amari Cooper? He's not a threat. #Packers
Great job of blocking by Cadet to allow that sack, those are that takes 18 years to learn and why Hayne can't play right now
#49ers still outgaining the #Bengals 111 to 82 in this jaw-dropping, exciting game. #CINvsSF
That's fine. Our offense is so good, a 98 yard drive should be a piece of cake.  #Packers
Just saw the Chargers pull Perryman off kickoff team and run Butler on. Enjoyed seeing #56 jog down on coverage.  #SDSJ
Great job by Bruce Ellington as he manages to make positive yards on a punt return
Whew! Worst undefeated 14-0 team In the history of the NFL #Panthers
Backup QB starting, legit defense vs team cant stop the run & Jeremy Hill getting no playing time? #makesense  #CINvsSF
Glad every loss this year for the Giants was in the last 75 seconds.  #wheresthetylenol
Oh yeah! Nothing more fun than mucking around in DOSBox trying to figure out CPU cycles and display schema...

Way to go! Good job! Good effort! Way to hold on to the ball! #Broncos. #Hillman4Prez2016
Giants lose to Panthers and now I have to watch my dolphins battle the Chargers #GreatDay
I hear Norman did pretty well vs. OBJ today. That’s what happens when you’re a product of the scheme.
Really breaks my heart to see Odell Beckham Jr lose after that ridiculous celebration
Panthers win on FG as time expires. Odell post-game should be fascinating ... .
That was the most well "orchestrated" celebration I've ever seen!  #NoFunLeague
So glad we can help other teams get their "firsts" here at Lucas Oil...  #ColtsNation
It's so great to see Gabby Logan, Clare Balding and Gary Lineker on TV again. We don't quite see them often enough, do we?  #SPOTY

I'm not a huge NFL fan, but this Panth/Giants game is entertaining #athletesactinglikebabies #justdukeitoutalready #playthegame
ARE THE PANTHERS FOR REAL NOW THEY JUST GAVE UP A TD
In this snooze-fest between #Colts and #Texans Colts 1st round pick WR Dorsett has 1 rec for 1yd. Great pick GM!
Wow, gave the. ANOTHER 1st down. Good job
The good news about ODB, is he takes losing well.
So glad we signed Cutler to that big ass contract extension..... #Bears
Not sure if I should spend my money on the #miamibeachbowl or the #bocaratonbowl.
The Panthers are the worst 14-0 team of all time.  lots and lots of
Non functioning lock on train bathroom. Brilliant.  #AccidentalPenis

Really enjoying that my Killer Mike/Bernie Sanders tweet got such love last night. That's my fame peak, I'm Twitter-tiring!
Which network has the Super Bowl this year? Hard to tell with how little they advertise it.
I had twizzlers for dinner. Again. Being a grown up sure sucks.
Wow...Morris goes for 48 yards, which if I'm not mistaken, is the exact amount of yards he's rushed for all season  #Redskins
How could Tom Brady be so good with fully inflated balls? I just don't understand.  #nfl #bradysthebestever
Love that the Titans o-line looks like they block better for the backup than they do for their franchise QB. #Titans
2 and out. How about some ball possession, guys? I mean really. #TENvsNE #Patriots
Patriots special teams has been nothing but a strength this season. #TENvsNE #Patriots

That Bills defense, you guys. Scary good.
Glad to see the bills got the penalties under control this game  #BUFvsWAS #sametweetdifferentgame
RGIII looks really good today. Crisp and accurate throws. Redskins fortunate to have him on their roster. #BillsVsRedskins #NFL
Eating an egg and Chicken at same time is horror.  #crossfit
#Bills firing on all cylinders today: Offense, defense, special teams.
I like how my sister only talks to me when she's injured and needs advice... I'm glad I'm useful to you.
Giants need to go to Ramses barden. He caused nightmares last time they played the panthers.  #nyg
With this swarming #Bills pass rush...gonna be a long day
wow I realllly enjoy spending my time with your bedroom and not you.
I love when I get steamed and start posting pictures on Instagram
Oh my god, OBJ is soooo good, how did he miss that? Oh my god.
Home Alone 2 #christmas #ofg # film fan

Oh good! That guy we all want to like says he didn't do the thing. The woman is clearly lying. That was a close one...
I love how the sun starts to set before 3:30
Two of my professors thought 8:00 was too early for our finals, so they moved them back to 8:30. #wow #hugedifference #tysm
I guess I am pretty dumb for calling something a proven fact, dummy me. Smh.
Body mess, bad habbit, ugly, loser. Oh yeah i'm gf goals
Why does clicking on a picture now make it smaller? Twitter is really winning in my book lately.
So when are the Pirates gonna jump in on Chapman?.....

Michele Fiore. So full of the Christmas spirit, and not racist too!
Remember folks - commemorate #PearlHarbor by not eating Asian food.
No, moving in the Monday of finals week and dropping furniture in the hallway won't make everyone in your dorm hate you...
That moment when you're trying to be a good friend, but people only think you know  and don't take you seriously. #helpme #monday
Kinda hoping my  comes through on the net. It would be such a loss for the recipients to miss out on their daily #sass.

Even the #Myntra #Ad proves that girls like rich guys.  #NoOffenceToAnyOne
"Gotta eat the booty like groceries" Is a pretty amazing mantra. So shocked it wasnt nominated for a Grammy.  #ALittle

When it comes to technology, the inability to understand what someone is trying to #COMMUNICATE to me is SO much fun!
Isn't it the best when you have a pounding headache that won't go away? I can't think of anything better
People using voice-to-text in public places are my favorite. Only slightly better than speaker phone in public.
Sometimes I say things that are obviously sarcastic and people take it quite literally. #fml
I love it when you buy something and then 2 days later you get a discount code sent to you via email.
Decorating the office for Christmas. Always a fun experience...

The new strategy is just like our old strategy only Better and Newer! Disarm Americans! No Fly Zone over ISIS! Don't Hate Muslims!
Get to spend my day just chilling at the old work building. My job is so difficult sometimes.
Hey Time magazine - you forgot to add Hitler to the list. Nice work.
Yay I'm sick so now I have this ringing in my ear that won't stop.  #sick #why
Had so much planned for today but no it wasn't important, would much rather be ill in bed
Can't we move on from #PearlHarbor? It's in the past. It's history. This happened so long ago. Let's live int he present.
Woke up this morning to a smoke alarm singing me the song of its people because it was out of battery. Great wake up call.
I didn't watch the #ObamaSpeech but I'm SURE we can all rest easy now since he's addressing REAL issues like climate change.
This 'no fly' list is a covert way to #disarm #Americans. DHS can put anyone they want on it.& they love #Constitutional #Americans
These last couple of days have been so good to me
So USC went with the maniac who failed at Florida, a school with unlimited resources. Yay.  #but #ForeverToThee
So many people read my tweets. Stop it!!! Stop for a minute to reply and RT , my phone will be broken because of millions mentions
So Sepp Blatter knew about corruption within #FIFA but did nothing about it......I wonder why?  #bbcnews
Up at 4 am for work and I didn't sleep well last night. It's going to be a fun day!!!!  #imsotired #life
Im not voting for Duterte since he's a womanizer, I'll vote for those who pose pious by hiding their dirty laundry.
It's always a lovely morning when I run into j places

Tweeting is a learned talent that sometimes makes you land on your beautiful face  #tweet
Got a whole 3 hours of sleep. This week is going to rock!  #Insomnia
My alarm did not go off this morning. This is a wonderful way to start my day. I hate that hour of "me time" before I go to work.
Love having to go to work 30mins early just to have a piss!
But yeah, didn’t take long for “fans” to moan that the remake isn’t what they wanted. Didn’t see that coming!
It's going to be such a good day bag broken already today :/  #notgood #bag #need #new #one
And that's exactly how I hoped I would spend my last night off before my work week starts all over again.
Ah, nothing like a brisk jog at midnight.
This is the perfect time of year to not be able to fall asleep #finals #BYU
Seems like everyone's camera was broke today. Even a pro photographer's
I keep getting hot and cold flashes and I can't sleep so this is great.
Gee hawthorne police dept. thanks for doing your job and protecting the residents of Hawthorne during that 99cent store incident.
You hate it because you don't get it, don't you?
Hospitals are an awesome place to try and get some sleep...  #pleasequietdown #stopslammingdoors
Remind me to put  next to tweets when I am being sarcastic. Or emoticons. Otherwise people get upset.
Yeah sure, I need linear equations to cross the street for coffee like how John Cena needs that to throw a punch.  #finalsweek
Hmmm twitter wants me to follow all these super fit ppl tonight. Twitter, you know I ate cheese fries for breakfast right? #healthy
Once never trends one Twitter anymore...I wonder why.
how dare twitter not have any prior knowledge of my personal life and actual interests, it's borderline shameful...
Is the game even fun for the #Warriors anymore?  Win 21 and counting. Everyone saw the court too.
I don't think there are enough Instagrams and snapchats of everyone's menorahs
Not scripted at all. Very real. <-  #rollseyes #ugh #WorkOutNewYork
Also I hate christmas and cmos sensors are a horrible thing we live with. If you don't hate me yet congrats
I get those jobs, with her trying to help and me trying to let her help without letting her push or hurt herself. So MUCH FUN

#KeepsMeAwakeAtNight panthers are 12-0.. so depressing. And what's worse, the Warriors are 22-0.
I would like to thank my English teacher for not chilling with the amount of homework she gives
I am shocked that THREE of our players have been hit in the back of head by Baylor players.
It's like finding out my favorite love song Is about sandwiches & I don't do sandwiches.
Defunding health care instead of addressing our high mass shooting rates... Sounds like America has it's priorities in order!
You learn something new everyday. Just found out that Muslim is now a race. #random #nonsense
Basically, we are doubling down on the interventionist foreign policy which has gone SO damn well for us in the past.  #ObamaSpeech

Being sick is awesome! Watching anime all day
God don't I just love late night uni work
#Obama: ISIL is so conventional, easily defeated on battlefield, so we got this thing, done deal, no problem.
I've never been more moved by a presidential press conference.
and that makes so much sense ..
I missed the President's speech. When does President Obama come for my guns? Is there a sign up sheet?  #copolitics
How dare Ayesha Curry tweet that she only wants to take her clothes off for her husband
Can't wait to hear and read he ignorant shit people post about Obama's speech tonight.
I feel so much safer now, thanks Obama.  #obamaspeech
Oh hello insomnia, how nice of you to rear your ugly head. Don't worry it's not like I have to be up in 4 and half hours  #insomnia

Don't you feel safer now?  #presidentialaddress #ISISnotISIL #SecondAmendment #Freedom
Of I feel so much better about terrorism after that Obama speech.  #whatajoke
I don't know about the rest of you, but I sure feel a lot better about ISIS after hearing those words from our President.
Can't wait for all the Facebook status about Obama's speach tonight
Stronger screening? Obama is a racist!!!!
I guess that makes up for it.
I feel soooo much safer in my own country. Thanks for the warm and fuzzy feeling prez.
Man! There goes our playoff hopes
Did Kane set a record or something, you would never know looking at my Twitter feed.
The Rams are doing so great. They definitely deserve a new stadium. #Rams
Fucking refs screwed New England on that last play of the game.
I wonder what the NFL's work release program is. #aaronhernandez
The Eagles beat the Patriots. Is the Brady/Belichick combo on the hot seat?
The Eagles beat the Patriots! The Eagles are going to win the Super Bowl! Chip Kelly for president!
I really think politicians can fix all of our problems with public education. ( )
My internet keeps going in and out and that's great because I have to take a test tonight....
I've made 200 tweets. Only 999,800 more to get a prize!
If President Obama comes out and says everything #Breitbart wants him to say I'm sure the right would suddenly support him fully.
So glad we have Dave Bolland for 3 more years at $5.5M a year to center our 4th line.  #FlaPanthers
Oh darn,josh kline hurt? But hes suuch a great lineman  #obviously. every freaking time ive seen brady on his ass, 67s been close by
I think the Patriots were offsides on that onside kick.  #NCvsClemson
Chiefs averaged 34.3 points/game in November...the two missed points will drag that number down this week.
Saints D comes up big again......
Wow the Pats haven't given up 35 unanswered since before I was born #BradysDone
I’m so proud that my son has learned how to burb on command before learning to form his first full sentence.  #inthegenepool #fb
I love PAT chaos, this is just what the #NFL needs more of.
How does Demarco Murray have ONLY 6 rushes!?!? #WhatAWaste #NiceJobChip
Gee, maybe Brady should stick to receiving.  #whatisgoingonhere
Hey #NFL thanks for replacing this #PHIvsNE for #CARvsNO for the game of the week..good job  #FlyEaglesFly #eagles

I see the #Chiefs have not made any halftime adjustments. That's awesome.  #analysis
Man I can't wait for my timelines to full with anti-POTUS remarks in a few hours. Such  friends. Still tired from the usual droll
In all excitement today I just hope #Bills fans remembered 2 sit so "regulars" weren't upset #BillsMafia  #stayhome #Buffalo
I'm so hungry I might be writing this tweet from the other life...
Been slacking the past few weeks...gonna hit the workout hard tomorrow and I can't wait  #killmenow
I just love how government can infringe on our right of freedom of speech when it's against something they believe.
"How do you not know this? I'm a 'lawyer,' which I'm pretty sure is French for 'kind of a dick'." #tsl  #funny #lawyer #law
So glad Philly got rid of Brandon Boykin to pick up EJ Biggers. He's so good.
Wow...that Eric Fisher was one awesome pick NUMBER 1 OVERALL!!!  #Chiefs
bro I've been a crew fan since I was like 2, I love them
Oh my gosh did Blount just reverse his route and not run into the pack? holy cow that's ingenious . #PHIvsNE
A nonsense conversation. Thank you guys for ruining my sleep. I really love you.
It's refreshing to see the best goalkeepers in the league on display.  #MLSCup
Some great keeping in this #MLSCup so far
Cooper dropped a ball. Obviously it's because DJ hayden is playing #raiders
A ban on guns, of course! Couldn’t be any less effective than the current ban on murder.
Ah, the yearly wheeze has arrived... YAY.
Excited for that 6 hours class later.
Dear Josh Brown, Thank you so much for that kick. It was fucking amazing! You sir are the greatest man in the whole world!  #WTF
And to follow up on my previous tweet: I'm glad the Dodgers signed Utley. Really fits the mold of going younger!
Good wifi coverage in that abandoned block of flats en route to Syria....  #Homeland
"Idk what ph balance is, but I'm pretty sure you can't pee it out." #tsl #lawyer  #funny
Thank goodness my local Fox affiliate is staying with this game. Giving the people what they want! #AZvsSTL
Pinion could've have kicked a touchback right? Smh!  #49ers
Hey, at least they have 4 days to right the #Vikings ship & work on Teddy's throwing elbow/technique.
About time they pull Dalton and put McCarron in only took them 12 games.
Omg. Deadlock. No one saw that coming  #XFactor
Well, in the #Browns' defense, it was a short week.  #hitreset
Isn't it so great having a defensive guru as a head coach?  #jags
Can Schmidt kick field goals? Just wondering. #Bills
Please give us more #SFvsCHI , #NFLRedZone
Smart play. 3rd and long, best try a short run...  #HoustonTexans
Falcons have 0 yards after the catch today.  #sorta
Field goal? What a waste of a drive.
Good thing Tanny has more input in the play calling. #Dolphins
Hereeee we go with the OUTSTANDING 4th QUATER defense by the NYG ..
Nice to see the Canes are rewarded as the 4th best ACC team with the Sun Bowl.
The vikings wont be on top for long. I know that's surprising considering they always win the NFC north and superbowl  #GoPackGo
You know what's better than going to tax class for the past 4 months? Re-listening to the 2 hour lectures 2 days before the final
Woohoo! Already to the 20 yard line on this drive. .
Damn. Iowa should lose impressively more often.
Seriously? I am in impressed Robbie. And Langford appears to be running better than Forte? Awesome  We cannot lose here boys.
Omg you can penalize the Seahawks?!
All these animal torture and kid starvation commercials are getting me in the mood for the holidays!
I see Jimmy Carter was in church this morning. God won't fix cancer you right wing gun toting nut job.  #SanBernardino
If anyone wonders why I'm increasingly using  tags, it's because I've had strangers repeatedly assume I'm serious lately.
"Look. Just because you are 'offended,' doesn't mean I was being 'offensive.'" #tsl  #lawyer #law #realtalk
Yea, lady, you totally just cut in line in front of me. Thanks for acknowledging it.  #XMasShopping
It's still a mystery how males can become tougher just by drinking booze... How does that work!
I don't always fuck up , but when I do , I FUCK UP BADLY  #trying #not #to #cry
Way to be aggressive #49ers under 2min in half & kicking away in the 3rd quarter.  #FireGeepChrist #nfl #frustratedfan #beatthebears
on a lighter note, ouat is on tonight woo hoo
It makes me wonder how people can stand my constant negativity.  #youwotm8
I really gotta stop wearing this "please tell me what my ex-girlfriend is up to" shirt to work.
#Browns I would keep Johnny Football on the bench .
Imagine how good Robertson would be if he got the run of the balls occasionally
Ohhhh red zone struggles, you're so fun.  #AZCardinals
Odell Beckham Junior dropped a TD. #Bum
Nice to see the #Dolphins offense responded to the OC firing
Why in the world would Browns rush Mingo AND Kruger
Overtired, cranky children paired with this #Browns game..... perfect little Sunday.
My team is doing AWESOME today.  #FantasyFootball #NeedABetterSecondHalf
David Cameron reaches 10 years as leader of the Conservative party. What a glorious 10 years it has been.
I never noticed it, but I look like a scared pussy in most of the fanarts I receive. Those jump scare montages sure did their job!
We're super deep at receiver, we'll be fine.
Man I really thought auburn had a shot at the college football playoff!! I'm heartbroken  #hahahahahahahaha
Really glad the #Cowboys got rid of Dwayne Harris
Glad to see the NFL officiating continues to be good.  #HOUvsBUF
Of course if you roll out of bed in the middle of the night your makeup is perfect. A++ realism, movie.
When the Ortiz brothers go to their Mensa Meeting, do they carpool or go separately?
Another day, another one-handed catch by Odell Beckham Jr. Yawn... #NYJvsNYG
It's ok. Defense is overrated. #billsvstexans

I like it how god created Light in Day 1 of Creation and then made the light source on Day 4.  #Religion
I love it so much when my paternal grandmother tries to get on me about my weight.
Peter Hitchens says all he heard in Hilary Benn's #SyriaVote speech was emotive piffle. Should have taken his ear plugs out then...
If climate change & evolution r real, ppl r gonna b in for a rude awakening when these sad polar bears turn into angry sea bears.
Democrat logic: OMG a bomb just killed a bunch of people. We need to restrict guns so people can't make bombs. Seems legit.
Wow. I love Milner. He's amazing. I'm so glad we're paying him so much, he's very derserving.  #lfc #newvliv #ynwa

So the war on drugs is being won then.  #Stereosonic
I'm confused. Is Obama Muslim or Atheist? You keep saying he's the anti-Christ so how is he both.  #thisconversationthough
A lone wolf attack? Clearly masterminded from Syria. Bombing totally worth it.  #marr

Love how Iowa is trashed, dismissed as "out", as if going 12-1 makes you a total bum. Gotta love college football
Fire Ferentz. Clean house. Change QB's. New offense. New defense.
When you find the sippy cup straw that you thought you lost weeks ago.
So excited I get to be at work tomorrow from open to close LITERALLY
Went shooting. Forgot earplugs. Only a 1911 45 cal. No big deal.  #Deaf
Refs gonna call that one back..
Idea to reduce mobile network traffic: Implement #OddEvenFormula to reduce call drops.
Big ten refs are very good at their job.
Don't make it harder 4 people 2 purchase guns/ammo cause god forbid we actually did something 2 cut down on shootings  #guncontrol
Isn't it so nice to be ignored. :)
You lose an 80 yard TD but get 15 yards from the penalty as consolation. Good job college football!
Well at least South Alabama has basketball to look forward to now.
I wonder if Obama tries to say Syed Farook and his wife were NRA members tomorrow night in the Oval Office Address??
That pass wasn't Kessler fault guys!  #USC #SMH
I hope yall realize this was a #PremierBoxingChampions fight! Everyone say "Thank you #AlHaymon"! #GenuineSentiment or  #Boxing
Why would u want to pressure the QB? Touchdown Iowa
Couldn't they have let the defense rest? #hawkeyes
I bet Stave makes that throw!!!!!
I would hope that the Knicks will put Porzingis back even tho he has 5 fouls. You're allowed 6 before you're done!  #NBA #DFS
"I already told you mine Myū." "But if World Peace is out of your leauge, a nice, Fluffy scarf would be GREAT."

Ok now Sam Mitchell, be sure to leave Towns and and his 20 and 8 on the bench until 1 minute left in the game.  #Timberwolves
Boy I'm surely glad the rest of these championship games are setting the example for truly great football.  #sec
Right it is inexcusable he should've him in his knee...
Well someone called me to work and TADAA!! im at work #Great #WorkWork

Hey Clemson coach, way to show leadership.
Hope Teasdal feels good about that decision lol
Convo's that abruptly end are the best....
Went for dinner at a Stanford hangout. The golf claps and whispered excitement each time they scored was inspirational.
Twitter was clowning Bama when we only had 2 points around this point. Guess 3 or 6 is much better.
Saturday night as a homeowner #Excitement mixed with #intrigue =  :)
Woop woop 4 hours of sleep tonight for 9 hours of work tomorrow. No I'm not gonna die of exhaustion  #stilldrunkaf

Fixing elevators is so fun! I love it!
Why yes, working a 15 hour shift IS my favourite thing to do on a saturday  #sodead
Thankfully, as a teacher, my job eval depends on the performance of 16 year olds on a test, not 20 year olds on a football field.
I need my safe space...They just played the National Anthem before Iowa/Sparty. This song represents our imperialist history.
so glad to see unbiased reporting by my favorite #espn anchors
Gotta love those days where everything is perfect at work and you even get to smash your hand between trusses!
44 carries, for only 189 yards.. 1 TD and 1 fumble.. Yea. Looks like a heisman winner to me...  #Baker4Heisman
Eating 2 meals a day when I'm working 12+ hour shifts is doing me so much good
Yup. That sure does look like the number 2 team in the nation
I'm sure Saban has Henry running the ball in a 2 score game with 5 min to play so he can get 2,000 yards and not to secure the win.
I just love it when my computer freezes while I am working on a website & I lose everything!
And there Florida goes again showing how much class they have.
ooo word classes... so much fun  #Revision
Man SEC football is so exciting . Please run more dive plays out of I-Formation and Singleback #SECChampionship

The fact that Joe wants Abi out of the game over anyone else goes to show you how great of a mastermind he is  #Survivor #REN
Police confirm that the San Bernadino gunmen used assault weapons. I'm glad we got rid of that ban in 2004.
So, people on the TSA no-fly list can legally purchase firearms. Because that makes sense.
I say today’s mass shooting was exactly what the founders had in mind when they wrote “well regulated malitia.”  #WhatsWrongWithThis
Initial reports: One of the shooters, the guy who was at the meeting & returned, is Bob Smith, a Lutheran farmboy from Iowa.
Syrian refugees are Americas biggest problem.
Felicity already knows about Oliver's son. Thanks to Barry. Thanks Barry.  #TheFlashArrowCrossover
I am having a hard time wrapping my finger around how a mass shooting can happen in a state with such strict gun laws?  #California

I wonder why there are constant shootings in America.....  #BanGuns
Hooray, another mass killing by white dudes!  #SanBernadino #StopTheMadness
#SyriaVote so the best way to deal with IS is by killing innocent civilians in Syria? Makes perfect sense.  #FixingWrongWithWrong
#Tytlive southern cops taking the freedoms of black people...... Nooooooooooooooo.
So glad that our strict gunlaws in #California prevented shooters from killing more unarmed defenseless people in #SanBernardino
uh-oh, suspect went into a church proves he's not muslim right? must be a christian who was upset about #PP and #ClimateChange
#pbsnewshour #SanBernadinoShooting but hey it's not fair to be concerned about #guns in white guys hands
3 spontaneous shooters very well prepared as per #Govt source Which is it & is source same 1 who thought up #Benghazi movie motive
When will California pass gun control laws??? Oh wait.  #Idiocracy #SanBernadino
Because going to war and killing innocent civilians isn't at all like terrorism and won't create more terrorists at all
Mass shooting? What? Wait... are the refugees already here or...? #NOPEjustwhitepeople
Watching Viagra commercials with your in-laws is the best.
Can't wait to hear about Gun control tomorrow at class and how it'll solve our countries problems...
Hmm - why would police need armored vehicles? That's seems so excessive.  #SanBernadino
Love how I arrived 5 mins early for my appointment only to be still in the waiting room 45 mins later.
#syriaairstrikes Today I learnt that college students have more knowledge of international affairs than members of Parliament.
We should definitely make guns illegal bc the criminals who already break the law will surely follow that one
I just heard a teacher say, "what will I do with all this extra time?"
I love that I'm loved so much by Kane's dads family.
Wow, I can't believe there's an active shooter in #SanBernardino Thank God this never happens
Apparently according to my fb it's disgusting to be calling for gun control with bodies still warm. I guess prayers do so much more
With so many thoughts and prayers going out over the past few years you'd think gun violence would stop.  #guncontrol
Wow, good job MPs. I feel 100% safer about living in London now.  #SyriaVote
I've got an idea, why don't we cause widespread damage hoping a bomb only affects a single person a time??  #NotInMyName

Another shooting in America? Let's continue to work on banning Syrian refugees.
well that vote result on the amendment means that they'll vote through the military action in Syria #terrific
This shooting in San bernardino must be caused by climate control!
Gosh darn-it!!! If only those disabled people had guns on them to defend themselves, this never would've happened!!!  #SanBernadino

Nope, nothing we can do about all these shootings.Nothing at all.This is all perfectly normal.Carry on.  Time to renew the xanax.
Out of sesh 36 early, snuck into end of TEACH in Mariners for a coveted spot in sesh 47. #doorgirlhookeditup #FSATC2015 #winning
so many shootings & the worst part of it all is that literally the only thing we can do is pray & nothing else could ever change it
#SanBernadino gotta love all the people making up Middle eastern names and claiming they know it's the identity of the shooter

Don't you hate it when teacher are nice, give a reasonable amount of homework, and design tests to be passable.  #thestruggle
He said he was a "good person?" Wow. By the sound of that, I think Saban was in on it. Possibly made Taylor take the fall for him.
To the girls that date guys whether they have a truck or a sports car, if they are rich & have money. You ladies are doing it right

Yeah I can’t think of anything that could go wrong with drones flying around a city delivering parcels.
No irony in Assad's statement that ISIS has grown since the coalition airstrikes began. Clearly he had things under control.

Apparently if Jesus didn't talk about something being a sin, it's not a sin or it's not as important as the sin he talked about.
All to fulfill vague ethnocentric prophecies like Zecharaih 8:23! Its very hard to extract out the pro-jew bigotry of the OT.
I truly appreciate your attempts at communicating with me today.

I received, "Hi, My name is Olga. I want to be your friend..." for the third time. She is persistent, I give her that. #spam #email
The weirdest part of being part of a convo, is being tagged, but excluded in the reply. Makes one feel GREAT
And then I would be burned at the stake because I'd be coined as a witch. Humans are hilarious.  #humor #thankfulformyrights
So, they put a lot of thought into the title of the Walking Dead spin-off.  #FearTheWalkingDead #TheWalkingDead

My thoughts when a food package declares no preservatives: how thoughtful of you not to feed me toxins.

Gotta catch some Z's for this track meet tomorrow #hype
What did you do with your Sunday? Oh just worked a 13 hour shift at work. What are you doing tomorrow?probably the same.
Well. Today was not really eventful. Tomorrow should be. College! Biology 2! Woohoo.

Undertaker looks good. Looks like the internet was wrong for once #wrestlemania
If you love someone, you should not to stingy.

Getting pulled over is a really awesome idea for date night.
LOVE TO SEE SEASON 1 MOTHER OF HENRY REGINA!

Girls that like all my boyfriends selfies but don't like any pictures of us together are the greatest :-)  #pleasestop
Never would have guessed #StingVsTripleH would end up being NWOvsDX.  #Wrestemania31 #WrestleMania
UND vs Omaha would be a terrible national championship, wouldn't it? #NoStorylines  #BLAISvsHAKSTOL
ughhhhhhhhhh........... Like Blank Space totally has better lyrics than Thinking Out Loud or any other song
Soo the BIG was lagging in basketball this season right........?
I hate how Apink is so underrated  #Apink #kpop
Nice start to the game Blackhawks! #Blackhawks #CHIvsWPG
I like how Arnold Schwarzenegger never milked terminator
being home alone is fantastic, someone wanna come over?
More of Pablo Sandoval's fiancee, please. No need to talk about the match.  #TFC #TFCLive
You know its legit when someone gets 'hit' then stands up again so he can fall down.  #WrestleMania
Msu vs Wiskey championship would really show how weak the BIG10 is......... Especially, with how well the big 8 did in the Tourny!
Daniel Bryan won IC title wow didn't see that coming.....  #WrestleMania
#WrestleMania #WM31 DB wins, that wasn't obvious.
Family is over. Dad is goibg on the longest anti-transexual rant ever. This was unprovoked. Yay family.
Like oh those straights are so dumb I can't deal
So glad I don't like sleeping or have to be up at 4.30! #NoteTheTone
Can't believe the #NHLBruins are letting the Canes hang around in this game. Nothing like playing with desperation.
From last to first...Way to go #YesMovement!!! #WrestleMania
John Calipari, Mike Krzyzewski, Tom Izzo, Bo Ryan. Nope, coaching isn't important at all...  #FinalFour
Thanks, Anthem for just now notifying me you were hacked in December. I hadn't heard anything about it, so thanks for the letter
Thank you for those kind words

Glad to see some fresh blood in the men's final four.  #Duke#Wisconsin #MSU#Kentucky
Amazing booking for that battle royal.  #WrestleMania
Glad Big Show looked strong in that match.. He needed to prove himself after 20 years of main event status. #WresleMania
Nice to see WWE planning for the future by giving that new guy Big Show a push...  #WrestleMania
Big Show is finally getting the push he deserves  #WWE #WrestleMania
You haven't lived until you've done a 24 hour roaming guard shift.
Big show getting a push... i'm sure it's gonna payoff  #WrestleManiaKickoff #WrestleMania
Glad big show got the win, a young up and comer like him needs something to build his career on #WM31
Being the stepchild is so much.
Blueblood programs getting calls late in the game, I'M SHOCKED  #DukevsGonzaga
The Ascension is so over now! LAUGHING MY FUCKING ASS OFF! #WrestleMania
Gonna hang out with some complete losers tomorrow #ohmygodcantwait
#WWE #WrestleMania From Main Show to Pre-Show way to honor Andre's legacy WWE.
I'm loving the refs this game. They're the best.
Risky strategy by #Duke of not getting the ball to the best player in the nation. Let's see if it works out for them  #DukevsGonzaga
Yes, we'd much rather have a musical performance by some no-marks than that match on the main card. #WrestleMania
could really go a game of pirate kings I WISH SOMEONE WOULD INVITE ME TO IT FUCKKKKKKK SAKEEEE
It sucks when you put effort into something that, looking back, might have been a waste of time. #awesome  I'm going to the gym.
Man the Big 10 really sucks.
Like Kevin Hart and TI would give a pants about Zayn leaving
lately timing has been very awesome!
There is a bathroom attendant at the Saban Theatre directing traffic with a variety of hand signals. It's not creepy at all.  #true
It seems the "train" carrying the results from some parts of the country has derailed on its way to the collation centre....
So glad it's going to rain in Tupelo this week because my yard desperately needs the moisture
"Don't be a bitch." ... I'm cured...
I'm pretty sure my cause of death will be poorly timed  .

#REDWINGS 2 goals early... let NYI score 2. #WayToGoRedWings  #DETvsNYI
Being on an Acela with a bunch of spring breakers headed back to college is only adding to the mix... #SundayFunday
I'm so over school. I really don't wanna go this week. but atleast we have 2 days for spring break
#wrestlemania Already sucks 2 of our seats are blocked effectively separating our family #thanksalot
Ruining people,s brunch to scream at them and tell them they're racist. Gosh Im sure that will help race relations #BlackBrunchATL
Does somebody have some Pom Poms for Grant Hill? Makes sense having him do Duke games
#cconck And let's not even mention dead trans people.
#cconck OF course kinky people don't need legal protection. We're just on the fringe.
This would cap a wonderful sports year: football title for tOSU & basketball title for Moo U.  Pitiful year continues. #GoBlue
Majority of guys begging for a 'fit chick' but get turned off by sweat... lol not feeling the irony?  #getyourheadouttathegutter
Obviously the cream of the crop are visiting today.
How can they ruin this moment by allowing parents families on the court?  #thingswriterssay
Thank you for beating NC State and then losing Louisville!
Yup, another down year for #B1G.
Izzo could be a pretty good coach if he could only learn how to win in March.
Boy, that Big 10 sure was overrated...
Jonathan Taylor: Booted out of Georgia for domestic violence arrest. Same happens to him at Alabama. He might have a problem.
Wish the BIG 10 has some quality teams....
I wouldn't box out either in this situation if I was Michigan State
Tomorrow I get to write two exams that add up to 80% of my grade. YAY!
Call the goaltending and this game is over. First game all year the refs made an impact.
I've been told that if you block explicit music, pandora deletes itself?
My day just gets better and better
C'mon Verne, it's 10-straight not 10-unanswered. Didn't you get the memo from AP? #MarchMadness #apstyle
Wait, did they call a foul on Michigan St??? WHAT IS GOING ON!!!!!
Tom Izzo is friends with Steve Mariucci? What an interesting tidbit I hadn't been told before
Bray Wyatt injured his ankle preparing for his match against the Undertaker tonight!! Jus awesome!  #WrestleMania #tapeitup
So glad that this race is on Fox Sports 1 so that Fox can show some crappy movie instead
Well done to the knobs who set off flares and stole a corner flag during the Ballarat RD v Victory Youth match.  #Dickheads.
Waiting for the body that is #Poldark2015 of course I am looking at the storyline as well

And notre dame chokes the game away, pretty good defense they played on towns all night......
Yay more Ashely Judd....  #NCAATournament #Kentucky

So great job UK, you and your 9 McDonald all Americans won a tough game tonight, who would have thought?
Really hope Kentucky has a go-to guy.
Damn this game is good, even better that I can't watch it.  #sirusxmradio #Kentucky #NotreDame #NCAATournament
The real winner in #MarchMaddness is all these timeouts
I can't believe they're not showing #AshleyJudd after #Kentucky just retook the lead
Geez, wonder who the announcers are pushing to win this game.  #NotreDamevsKentucky
To be fair to Kentucky, if this were the Eastern Conference playoffs, they'd have a 7 game series to rebound from tonight.
Timbers never fail to make me hopeful about winning a game, only to lose in the worst possible way. Keep it up.  #boo
Just saw the red card replay. Ugh. And apparently Kasey was spot on on the call?

A lot of firepower vs the houthis in #Yemen a bit of an exaggeration maybe,even #Iran in direct conflict wouldn't need that,
I wish TBS would show Aaron Rodgers and Olivia Munn more... Haven't seen them enough.
Omg I laugh so hard ahah
Seriously #CBS? Reruns instead of #MarchMadness #RegionalFinals? Yeah that's a good idea ...  #BBN #DoesEveryoneGetTBS?

I Hate these stupid Vines, where a guy hits a girl & everyone laughs... like HAHAHAHAHA you just assaulted a girl good for you

I'm glad you find my pain funny...
RT BigMacAttack20: Hampton only down 19! They got this! #lol  #MarchMadness
Nice Palms? Yeah that's not awkward at all Kai!  #TVD
Wow. A dirty cheap play by georgetown. Thats really shocking.  #MarchMadness

Do I get my wisdom teeth pulled over break or get my hair done? Hmmmmm, tough decision
Glad to see that whole decommitting from IU to play for Kentucky thing worked out so well for Trey Lyles.
I struggled whether to pick Hampton or UK... I ultimately chose UK, but it took me a best out of 7 coin flip to decide...  #Tourney
So switching my sleep schedule from third shift back to first all within a couple days is going really well ....
It's almost as if authentic learning experiences are more meaningful than memorizing stuff for a test.  #ofcoursetheyare

I dig when people hound me for days on end after I've already given them a firm answer...
#Giroux only scored just NOW. #RemoveCaptainClaude
Two of my favorite players made two of the smartest decisions in bball history.
SHORTER: Reagan began giving Pd's military weapons. You'd think after all these years they'd have also been given body & car cams.
Berube has some splaining to do on this move. Maybe he's trying to ignite the offense?
Kentucky's struggling, they're not up by 40 yet. What's going on!?
I wonder if these announcers think this should be a technical foul???  #ArkvsWoff
Wait - I can get 50,000 followers for a mere $150? Suh-weet! Because that would just be so damn meaningful.
Everybody that show up and stay till the end gets a free lap dance from a slut of your choice  #jokes #ifyoutakemeseriouslyyoustupid
Cincy wins. American athletic conf best in the country
Upset alert! Hampton up by 1 with 37 minutes to go.

bout to watch Hampton do some work!!! #BeatKentucky  #iwish #forrealtho #NCAATournament
Only one thing better than rejection letters/emails is none at all, keeps you guessing and on your toes!  much. Bah
Happiness is hitting every red light on the way home
I have the tolerance of a 12 year old girl and the sense of humor of a 15 year old boy. This never makes for #awkwardlifemoments
I sure wish they would fix college basketball. These tourney games are incredibly boring
Only things I've eaten today: a Popsicle, Canes, and greek yogurt. Yay for health, nutrition, and spring break next week!
Sure has been a boring day for college basketball.....
Fact: using the f and n word every sentence makes u sound intelligent and intimidating.
Such a great wardrobe choice, cyn. Flowy dress on a windy day. #smart  #ahhh
I thought there would be a few more close games today.  #MarchMadness
Love it when a meeting gets scheduled for late Friday afternoon
Hold up NZ - so you replaced a bully with a racist on a scripted reality "talent" show? Good going...
Harry- thanks for telling us what "arrangement" means...we are just not privy to such difficult musical jargon.  #AmericanIdol
Thank you, Purdue, for your inability to make free throws #justkidding  #angry

Maybe, just maybe, 'Nova is the real-deal afterall.  #duh #NovaNation #LetsmarchNova.
no school for me tomorrow. love having a cold
so happy to know they're more important to you than i am.
So Cincy has a player ejected for punching an opponent. Don't think that's ever happened to the Bearcats before.
Oh boy, I really know how to pick them..
Go to a party or hangout with a guy I like... Hmm Such a tough decision
my day keeps on getting better and better.
I went to Starbucks to discuss all the Race Problems but nobody there knew anything about NASCAR...
I think I'll start a real meaningful conversation tomorrow morning during rush hour. #RaceTogether Like that'll happen
so a 1 handed slash is a penalty on the B's yet a hard 2 handed slash is not against the sen's yes that sound about right
My bracket is still perfect! #MarchMadness
Nova wins. Big East is the best conf in the country.
can't wait to fight with 10000000 people to try and board from palo alto #caltrain
This construction in the parking lot is so swell.... Not like we need a soundproof room for radio or anything... #OhWait
depending on what happens in the near future there may be a mass exodus from FA. Gee I wonder why...
First player I have seen ejected from the #NCAATournament hard to believe he was from #Cincinnati #Bearcats
I can't believe that a Cincinnati player got ejected. That is a surprise. No one ever would have thought that would happen.
Gotta love home cooked meals aka eggo waffles
Revolutionary idea? Let's just ditch 5v5 altogether and switch to 3v3 - PEOPLE WILL LOVE IT!
Well just saw my old man and didn't punch him in the face. If you ask me I'm making wonderful progress...
That 10 minute ab workout really helped a ton
We've got a scrum. Shocked that Wilson's in the middle of it.

Also I got to meet a former National FFA Officer last night, NO BIG DEAL.
I love health alerts from daycare.
#dataretention won't store your browsing history, just a list of all sites you visited, and when. See the difference?
Gee. Look at that. Leafs losing in the first period. That never happens.

I just love it when people put photos of their injuries on Facebook.  #vomit
I had Iowa State in the Final 4. Four teams I picked to advance all lost in the 1st round #BustedBracket Ty Ole Miss Baylor & SMU
Super happy I paid for the upgrade in insulation for soundproofing. Especially when I can tell the neighbour is vacuuming.
guys, this was the BEST FUCKING SPRING BREAK EVER i got to wake up at 6 am every single day and i even got my heart broken today
Oh, I can see there's going to be a lot of defense in this game.  #NHLBruins #twogoalsin59seconds

It's always nice being made to feel like shit just before you go to bed. A really fantastic way to end the day
I still have detention tomorrow and monday yay awesome cool fun  af
Tomorrow my last copyright appeal expires. What could possibly go wrong?
It's about time #OhioState sports won a big game this year
Thanks to NASCAR for developing a Chase system that has everyone talking about in March, 6 months before it actually happens
But Roy needs to retire so UNC can hire Shaka Smart right?
Big 12 is having a great showing so far in the #NCAATournament.
This time next week I'll know whether I'll be taking the witness stand. What an exciting time to be me
"You're such a sarcastic little bitch." Yeah tell me something I don't know
Obama is messing up with mandatory voting. He should instead be offering a tax break for voting.
This surgical write up is really fun
These announcers are totally not biased toward Ohio state.
Let's play some wwe supercard #fun #amazing
Yes, Iowa State lost. Broke a lot of folks brackets. At least the folks can go back to their fun exciting lives of living in Iowa.
That was an amazing coaching job by our amazing basketball coach! #rollingeyes  #HottyToddy
So the #Big12 isn't the best basketball conference in the country? Who knew?
Thanks to all the cricketing journos, great insight into how Chris Gayle plays throw downs
The #Big12 is winless so far? #Shocked  #MarchMadness
Taking Transit Rd north to south is super fun.
I didn't know that water was only available for people who go to uni. I am 70% illegal.
It shows a lot of class to message a random woman that she has "nice knockers."
Way to play with compassion rebels.
Well, thanks #Baylor! My bracket is off to a FANTASTIC start because of you!  #MarchMadness #bracketbusted

I feel so bad for the big 12 and their arrogant fans #0-3
Welp. It was nice having Gregg Marshall.
Every Big 12 team is really stepping up to show how strong of a conference the Big 12 is.
At the CPA, there's some good news for your Thursday!
Dear obnoxious drama queens of the school, try to eat your make-up. Maybe you become beautiful on the inside or maybe you die.
Sweet it's supposed to snow again tomorrow! #enoughalready #oldmanwinter
At least the football playoff committee knew what it was doing by pre-eliminating the Big 12 from contention, amirite?
I love my ability to do great on exams. I love how smart I am. I love collage.
Amir needs to reign in his effort. . He had to keep this pace up for a whole 40 minutes  #MarchMadness #GoBucks

WTF: "As of May 18, 2015. This means that, at that time, BETSI will no longer be able to access your shop" Well that's helpful.
